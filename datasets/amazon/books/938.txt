 I'm a huge Suz fan ... but I really think she missed the boat on this one.  Her style has changed since she moved to hardcover & this book just fell flat for me.  The secondary storyline or FBI agent Jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple Cosmo & Jane.  Didn't like her at all & Cosmo lost his "Seal-ness" somewhere along the way.  Not a re-read for me
