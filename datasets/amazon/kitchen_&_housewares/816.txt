 Would look great if it lined up correctly.  Goes together very crooked & doesn't line up 100% with other parts, & there are only three major parts.  I ordered two holders, & both have the same problems.  May redrill the screw holes to line things up better, but may just return both for a refund.
 I love the look, & it would be great if things were done correctly
