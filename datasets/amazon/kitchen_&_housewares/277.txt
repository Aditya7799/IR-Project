 Don't bother buying the pots.  After only 2 months use, the inside edges are cracking off (I hand wash all the pots).  I have a fry pan of another brand that I have used for over 3 years and this never happened.  In addition, in spite of purchasing the 12 piece set and three additional pans, they refused to give me a $20.00 promised rebate.  I'm ready to junk the set
