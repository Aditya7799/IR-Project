 I bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets.  I used it once without a problem, seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac.  The 2nd time I used it I was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box.  The 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working.  I turned the machine off, checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing.  I manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem, so i turned it back on.  It was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning.  I turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily, which lasted for at least 2-3 minutes before cooling off. Don't waste your $$ on this and more importantly don't risk your safety with this fire trap
