 I have used this pan 3 times, twice to cook meat. It does not brown; the meat stick to the pan. I made stuffed artichokes last night and even though I used olive oil and water to begin the steaming process, the pan was a mess to clean. I have never had any problems with Myers anodized pans, 18/10 pans or,of couse, teflon. I'm not sure what this pan will be useful for but I believe I will only use it for vegetables or rice
