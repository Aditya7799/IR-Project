 To be fair, the design is great looking, size is ideal, and very functional.  However, beware of quality and packaging.  Whoever packaged this in Thailand did not take care, it has nicks and scratches everywhere..not to mention the dings in corners.  Paint in all the panels is inconsistent..therefore, you can see different colorations throughout different panels.  It is somewhat redish in stain tone, could be darker to be a true dark walnut.  Manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes, which makes it tough when assembling...got screws, just missing screw holes.  I only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman, not for the average person.  Recommend you need the following tools: Drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits(just in case), small bottle of dark wood stain(to touch up painting the scratches), and some patience.
 To continue, beware when placing this table on a true flat surface, it may have uneven stance...ok on carpeting.  And beware if displaying in bright lit areas...people may see the different paint tones, and difference between the two table.  Lasting, it is not 100% solid wood, some panels have veneer over particle board.  Heck, what do you expect for $69bucks..
