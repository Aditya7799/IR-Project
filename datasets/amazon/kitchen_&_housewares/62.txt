 I've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under "normal" use... something goes wrong at some point, and they just don't read right anymore.
 
 I love my Taylor digital thermometer, and these probes seem to work with the Taylor, but I went through 3 probes very quickly. I use them in my Weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking. In spite of the fact that I took care to not route the cable over a burner, or anything of that sort, each probe lasted only 5 or 6 uses.
 
 I had ordered three at one time, and all of them failed in a similar way.
 
 THERE ARE OTHER PROBES AVAILABLE that are better! There is one available on the Internet that is sold as a Taylor probe replacement. These probes look the same (with the 90-degree elbow bend and the right-angle mini-plug), but they have a smooth grey silicone-rubber sheathed cable, instead of a metal braid sheath.  I bought several of these (reasonably priced, around $12 or so), and so far, they have worked like champs with no failures and accurate readings from freezing to boiling.
 
 I would not recommend these probes based on my experience with very high failure rates.
