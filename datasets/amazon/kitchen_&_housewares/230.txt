 We have nothing but Henckels in our kitchen, as we love to cook, and everyone who cooks knows the value of good knives.
 
 I bought these without a second thought as I am used to Henckels quality.  What a surprise we got!  Made somewhere in Asia at bargain basement prices, I'm sure...
 
 While these probably do cut steak as well as any cheap serrated knife would, if you are buying them because they are Henckels and you expect a certain quality - don't.
 
 We returned these promptly
