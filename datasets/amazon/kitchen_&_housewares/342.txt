 I can not testify as to how well this unit makes toast. I basically bought this Toaster oven for it oven capabilities. 
 * I like the fact that the oven cuts off after the timer expires.     Things burn quicker in a toaster oven.
 
 * My major gripe: I often can not selected the correct oven temperature. For example, today I needed to warm up some bread sticks to go with Italian dish. The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven. 
 As a "don't fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short
