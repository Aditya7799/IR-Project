 We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties.  It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive.  After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers.  Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.
 Replaced the worthless Cuisinart with a Kitchenaid.  Would recommend avoiding Cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw
