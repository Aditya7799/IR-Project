 Thankyou for the reviews about quality.  I wanted to share with krups why I wouldn't buy there panini maker.  But when I tried to email customer service it was to complicated to let them know.  I also read there warranty and it appears your grills should be covered under one year.  But of course it adds at there discretion.  I am still deciding which to get but cuisinart has a 3 year warranty
