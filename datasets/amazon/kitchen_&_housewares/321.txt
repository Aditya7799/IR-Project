 I purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside.  It looks very nice and clean up is super easy.  The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.
 The first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.
 This is great, I thought.   The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either)  I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more.  It was not a pleasant experience.  Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try.  If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe
