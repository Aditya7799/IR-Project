 The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made.  In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely.  Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat.  Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily.  The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.  The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time
