 I bought both this and the similar version from Brookstone this year.  I was expecting a lot from the metrokane, but it turns out the Brookstone is much better.  It's $60, but the Brookstone version will last you MUCH longer than the $45 metrokane.
 
 Among the differences: The metrokane is made of plastic, the Brookstone is metal.  The Brookstone model comes with two bottle sealers, and it's case is made of very high quality leather-like material instead of cheap plastic.  Finally, my metrokane is brand new, and I've already managed to scratch the finish, since it's so cheap.
 
 If you're looking to get a new wine opener, do yourself a favor and BUY ANOTHER BRAND
