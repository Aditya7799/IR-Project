 i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw.
 i've read reviews about rival before but decided to go ahead and try it out.
 i really wish i would have kept my receipt and box!.
 the lid doesn't even fit and moves around most of the time making a bunch of noise and letting all the steam escape so all your liquid ends up being gone.
 the food is well done before the slow time is up. my chicken turns out SO dry and overcooked.
