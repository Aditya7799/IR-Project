 This liner is non-slip which is nice and even home made chocolate chip cookies dont stick BUT....it looks dirty and baking residue is sticking to it even after I have put it in the dishwasher.  My other liner is a Chef's Planet Full size baking sheet non stick bakeliner and while it can slip a bit and dosn't have a "finished" edge it dose have the advantage of wipe-down clean up and it arrives in a large sheet that you custom cut to fit any baking sheet(s) you will be using it with.  Don't buy this liner but do buy the non stick bakeliner from Chef's Planet.  It's not as pretty but it works like a charm!  After years of buying expensive parchment paper I'll never go back.  Also, it's less wastfull to use a bake liner instead of disposable baking sheets or parchment paper
