 We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped.  We looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task.
 
 Out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this Black & Decker.  At first it seemed "ok", but after just a few months we are back to using our old "manual - hand wind" opener.  The reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes.  Over time (not much time!) it gets too loose to hold a can anymore.  We lock it in place, it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter.  Repeat this scene over and over...!  At the end, the lid is never (REPEAT - NEVER!) separated from the can - ever!
 
 It's back to the hand held and a search of a decent electric continues
