 I've had to bring this back to Hoover 5 times in less than a year.
 The belt for the self-propelled motor comes off ever other time I use the vacuum. The on/off button has been fixed 3 times.  It works when it wants to.  Even the guy at the Hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off.  I have nothing good to say about this.  I'm  a huge Consumer Reports fan but they missed the boat on this one. They need to update their testing over the long-term. I'm still pissed I blew $250 on this ridiculous excuse for a vacuum
