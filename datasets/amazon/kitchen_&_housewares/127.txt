 I have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have ALL chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well.  I have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results.  They say they are "microwave safe" but after the first few uses, the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand (or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest!) and the food/liquid inside stays cold.  I am SO disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes
