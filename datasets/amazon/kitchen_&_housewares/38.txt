 As Shannon says, Kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments.  But be warned: these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl!  I purchased a new Artisan mixer &amp; ordered these to go along with it, but they are too small.  They do not fit the Artisan or KSM90 mixer bowls.  Models they fit are KBC5N, K5SS, &amp; KSM5 only
