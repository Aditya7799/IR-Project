 I would have to say that amazon gave me a good deal and  immediate delivery.
 
 Unfortunatly i had to return this item .  I havent been satisfied because the heating element heats up on the top rather than where it has to heat up. After ironing I  could still see a lot of creases. They dont mention about the base being a wood plank either. 
 I have used a Simplicity machine earlier and hence i know the quality of steam press but this machine is a waste of time and money. I would rather buy a normal iron to this or pay extra and buy a better one. But this is just my opinion
