 With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected
