 Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports.  It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning.  I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work.  If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports
