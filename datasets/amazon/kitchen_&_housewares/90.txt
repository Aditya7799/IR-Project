 The Black & Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is a product that you must not purchase. It is a total waste of money. It's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home. The are not enpough pro's and way too many cons. the only Pro: It makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want.
 CONS
 1. It's LOUD and Noisy
 2. The ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out.
 3. If not used correctly, it make a huge mess.
 4. It wastes ice cream. When you use this product, half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine.
 5. by the time its finished, ice cream is pratically melted.
 6. You ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine. The rest gets stuck inside the machine.
 7. You have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine.
 8. You have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself. 
 This Black & Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is such a waste of money. I So reccomend not buying this. Just going to Dairy Queen or Baskin Robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio
