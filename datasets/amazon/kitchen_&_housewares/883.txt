 I have tried and tried but the thing just makes weak coffee.
 
 I don't know how many different pods I have tried but the thing just can't make a strong cup. I have tried 2 pods - I have even tried making my own pods. If you try to jam too much coffee in it, it leaks and will try to pop it's head off.
 
 I have not done the proper "priming" that folks have mentioned and I also have detected a bit of a metalic flavor so that may be associated with my lack of effort.
 
 Am going to try to return it because it is just too expensive to make a wimpy cupa joe
