 I read the reviews after I purchased it. We made grated cheese (turned out so so) and *tried* to make hummus but it wouldn't even turn the blade and was very, very noisy. I'm returning it to Target tomorrow. If it can't stand up to crushing a few cooked beans then it's no good to me.
 
 Until I find a better one I'm using my 10 speed Osterizer blender I've had for 10 years. It made hummus easily
