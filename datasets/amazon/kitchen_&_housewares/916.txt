 I am very pleased with the dishes.  Years ago I owned Corelle dishes, and am now wondering why I went the way of the heavier dishes.  They don't scratch or take up a lot of space.  I bought two sets.  I love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at, especially since I purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match. It really makes for a beautiful table. I get compliments all the time.  I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the dishes  - in about 3 days.  I am always happy with my purchases made through Amzon.com
