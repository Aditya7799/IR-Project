 Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill.
