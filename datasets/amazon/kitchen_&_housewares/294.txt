 I've had this appliance since just before Thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice.  
 
 It's very cool the way the egg poacher works with the muffin toaster. BUT when I washed the egg poacher cup, a good bit of teflon came off. (I tried a second time and my poached egg was full of black teflon flakes.)  The appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the Back to Basics if there is a problem (rather than the retailer) so I did.
 
 I was told they would send a replacement cup immediately. 
 
 I can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other.  
 
 As I approached my 30 day return period, I called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately.
 
 Today (now 64 days after the first call) I called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago (but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week).  They mailed it from Utah.  I live in Seattle. 
 
 I am so not happy with their service, their attitude and now I'm even getting annoyed at the appliance.  Hopefully, no one else will have this problem.  But, just in case..
