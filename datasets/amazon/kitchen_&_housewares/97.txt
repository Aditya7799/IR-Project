 These dishes, first of all, are just beautiful.  The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous.  That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there.  I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else
