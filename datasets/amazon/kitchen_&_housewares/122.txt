 In theory, this is a good machine.  It did, in fact, work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell.  All of the urine, drinks, vomit, whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet, starts to pool under the holding tank.  As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house.  This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with.  The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit.  We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it.  Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don't buy this product !
