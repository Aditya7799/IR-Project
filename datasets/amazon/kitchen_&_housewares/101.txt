 I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.
 
 Go the old fashioned way, with a tray and a liner
