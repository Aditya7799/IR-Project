 I use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco.  You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half.  Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice.  It looks OK, but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart.  The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time (like white rice)
