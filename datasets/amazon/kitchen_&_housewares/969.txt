 Read the one review,five stars,have no clue as to why.It  is a piece of JUNK.First the handle closes on my fingers  continously,next it barely heats ,even on high,very poor  steam.The teflon soleplate is rough and drags on the fabric.I wasted my money on a piece of trash from China.   Hope this does someone some good.BEWAR
