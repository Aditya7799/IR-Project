 I had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews.  I wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs -- not heavy cleaning -- but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup (rescued mother cat and 4 kittens).  It does a good job for lint and hair but doesn't work on kitty litter.  It spits it around or keeps in roller section.  I thought I was using it wrong and tried it every way -- but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it's turned off.  I'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum
