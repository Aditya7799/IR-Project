 The waffle baker (formerly waffle iron) works great. Make that 'worked great.' For an entire month, then it died. It was, of course, under warranty. No problem, we were told, we will ship a new one to your door.
 
 Great! we thought. That was three months ago. The latest is the honchos see no reason to hurry(!) our replacement. Customer service is hoping -- not guaranteeing, not promising, but hoping -- we will get our replacement in mid-January.
 
 If, and it is a very big 'if', we get our replacement in January, that will make the score 5 to 1 against us. For six months they will have had our money, and for one month of the six we will have had a functioning waffle baker.
 
 It would seem that it is difficult to do much worse than buy a waffle baker that dies after a month with no replacement on the horizon.
 
 Great when it works, but it doesn't work, so how many stars is it really worth? 2? 1? None? A negative number?
 
 And it really was a great toy. Drat!
