 Contrary to the description above, this is NOT a non-stick pan.  I tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan.  Everything stuck to the bottom.  I used bacon grease on the pan before I made the eggs.  They stuck.  I used butter on the pan before I made the pancakes.  They stuck.
 
 I could not get the pancakes off the bottom of the pan without destroying them.
 
 This might be a good pan for searing and the cleanup that comes with it, but it is definitely NOT a pan to make breakfast or any other meal that requires a non-stick pan.
 
 My 12-year-old T-Fal with a worn surface outperformed this pan making pancakes.  I am definitely returning it
