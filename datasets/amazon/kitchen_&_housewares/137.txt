 The only positive thing I can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well.  Other than that, it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 - 50 marks.  Also, it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates.  Since using this thermometer, I have ruined more batches of fudge than I care to think about.  If you want a good candy thermometer, don't buy this one.
