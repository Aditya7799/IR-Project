 We have had the coffee maker about 2 months. It makes good coffee but if you pour water too quickly into the left side of the reservoir you get air bubbles in the water level indicator. Told to pour on the right side...
 The heating plate covering has come off on about 1/2 of the surface. What gives with that???
 Time to take it back and get another machine
