 I have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them I ordered this one.  I received it the first of Sept. 2006 and on Nov. 10 plugged it in, it sparked at the pot and that was it GONE!! I am sick about this as I had thought Cuisinart was a step above the rest
