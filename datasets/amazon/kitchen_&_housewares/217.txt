 Stop Be For You Buy!!!!  Should have saved my money.  Making pasta with this machine is disappointing.  The recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder.  I redid the dough 3 times before I was able to extrude it, and still it stuck together.  I should have listened to the rest of the reviews, but having owned a pasta maker/extruder before I thought it would be a piece of cake.  If I were you I would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer.  On the bright side though...The food grinder is wonderful
