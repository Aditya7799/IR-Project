 It is a strong knife; and easy to grip; but, I am upset about the rust spots on the blade, especially because I gave 2 people this knife as a gift!  It was very embarrassing!  I can't return it since it was a long distance gift.
 Shame on Oxo!   I gave it 2 stars because of the good grip; but, that is all it is....a good grip that looks like you bought it at Good Will
