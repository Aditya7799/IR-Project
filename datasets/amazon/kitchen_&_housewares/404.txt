 I thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan.  After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi == 4.5 * 4.5 * pi.  I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.  
 
 However, while the areas are the same, the volumes are not.  The pans are not deep enough.  While a 9-inch springform pan is 3 inches deep, these 4.5-inch springform pans are 1.5 inches deep.  Therefore, if you use the recipe for a 9 inch cheese cake, you have a lot of batter left over.  If you half the recipe, you produce baked goods that taste something like cheesecake but not as dense or as moist or as rich.
 
 I was very disappointed in these pans.  They may be good for something, but I don't know what.  They are well-made, so I won't throw them away, but right now I feel like they were a waste of money
