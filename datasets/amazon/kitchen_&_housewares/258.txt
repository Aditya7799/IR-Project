 Stainless my foot! I received these from my wedding registry and only just used them for Thanksgiving this weekend. After one run through the dishwasher, several pieces are rusted, the finish has worn off, and they are even pock-marked in places! I too threw away the box when I first took them out, and cannot find *any* information on warranty or how to contact Cambridge Silversmiths. 
   
  I've bought cheap individual pieces of stainless for *camping* that stood up better than this. I wish I'd put Oneida on my registry instead of this crap
