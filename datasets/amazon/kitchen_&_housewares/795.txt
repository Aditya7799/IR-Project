 I agree with the other reviewers; had the machine for a couple weeks, after 5 uses the machine didn't sit right on the base, causing the teeth between the base and the container to grind a bit.  After that, it was all downhill.  The base teeth were completely ground down within 2 uses.  Interestingly, the new back to basics smoothie machines seem to have a better locking mechanism, and teeth that seem to be made of more durabe material
