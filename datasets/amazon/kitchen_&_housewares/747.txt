   Owned Four Diffrent Styles. All Of them Worked ok But!!! The Pitchers Cracked, All Of Them!!!!My last New Mr. coffee Pitchers Lasted 3 Months and cracked (tea went all over the counter and floor)  If you just make tea once in a while It may be ok But i make 3 Pitcher's a day With three tea makers sitting in the kithen on a old compter desk. The Hamilton Beach Has lasted 5 Years With Only one pitcher,It works good I'm ordering 2 more to replace the 2 mr coffee Because all my pitchers Cracked. I know Most people don't drink That Much,But I do.
