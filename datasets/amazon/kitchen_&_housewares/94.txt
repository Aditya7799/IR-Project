 I purchased this Black &amp; Decker Food Processor on 12/30/04 at Target. I used it the first time to grate cheese and loved it. However, I used it tonight for only the 2nd time to chop some onion and celery and it started smelling hot. Smoke started pouring out the back. I will be returning to Target tomorrow and NOT purchasing another Black &amp; Decker kitchen appliance
