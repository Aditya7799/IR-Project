 The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet.  (Children would love this feature.)  You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm.  Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually.  You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use
