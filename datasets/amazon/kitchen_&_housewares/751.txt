 We love this machine, but it continually breaks down. The plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them. We have waited many times for parts, and we have waited too long on the service line needing help. 
 
 Look for another machine that uses steel or metal parts that won't crack, chip or snap when making the machines pasta recipes. Best to you
