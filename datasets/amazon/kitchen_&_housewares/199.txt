 I had slightly older edition of the Krups Crystal Aroma for several years, until I lost one carafe too many - if you're careless, when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop.  But that's my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.  
 The reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that Krups now makes a much better one.  "Aroma control" is a poor description for the recent line of Krups coffeemakers by that name actually do.  The Aroma Control machines have a simple, but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe.  More than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas, that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world.  Unless you're just in love with that round carafe, skip the "Crystal Aroma" and move on to the "Aroma Control" line.
