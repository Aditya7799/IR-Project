 I have purchased these plates from Amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in England.  So, I ordered more to go along with my current set to find that now they are made in India and were not of the same quality as those made in England. I sent them back. I will say that had I not already had the more detailed & colorful items, I might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than I did.
