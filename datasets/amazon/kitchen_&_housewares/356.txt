 I bought my first one about 14 months ago - it lasted about 8 months.  Motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over.  I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days.  I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty)  They quickly sent me out a new one.  This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms.  I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.
 Hope this helps.  By the way - I used grinders twice daily - in the morn and then in the evening - not like I was putting a whole lot of strain on them!
 Hope this help
