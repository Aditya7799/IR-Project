 I saw the 3-star reviews here, but decided to ignore them as this pan was on sale for a very good price.  That was a big mistake.
 
 1.  The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini-muffin pan.  
 
 2.  The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven, spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges, making flat, crooked, ugly muffins.
 
 3. The silicone did not release the muffins easily.  I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling, and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out.  
 
 I didn't even bother to try and wash it, so I don't have any comment about the ease of washing.  I won't be wasting any more time and ingredients in it, so I threw it away.  I wish I could get my money back.  This is not the quality you would expect from KitchenAid
