 I bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.  They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad.  Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork!  I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel.  I'm going back to my old flatware.  Sure glad I saved it!  DON'T BUY THIS JUNK
