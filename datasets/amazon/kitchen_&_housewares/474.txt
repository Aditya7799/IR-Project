 Box arrived damaged. Opened product, scratched on front, dirty on the inside. After I cleaned it up it worked great for a week then "poof". No power at all. Thought I may have ran it too much so I left it unplugged for 24 hours then plugged it back in and NOTHING. Additionally customer service for Edgestar is TERRIBLE. I have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 e-mails back and forth with their customer service (haha) reps and still have made zero progress. Buy with caution
