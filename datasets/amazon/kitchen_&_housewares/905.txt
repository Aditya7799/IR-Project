 When I received this coffee maker, it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out, then then heating element stopped working.  It took numerous calls to Braun, then of course I had to pack it up and ship it off.  Several weeks later it was returned to me and once again, it worked one time.  Again, it took several phone calls and I had to pack it up and send it off again.  I received a new unit that does indeed heat up, but has several other problems.  The drip shut-off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks, the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee, and if one uses a paper filter, it tends to overflow the filter basket.  This is the worst coffee maker I've ever owned
