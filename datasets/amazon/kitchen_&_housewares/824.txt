 I am very disappointed in this product.  I followed all the "mfgs. directions" on how to keep this board in great shape but it didn't matter. the board bowed and cracked after about 2 months (30 days over the Amazon warranty of course....)  it's so badly curved we are waiting for it to turn into a sphere.
