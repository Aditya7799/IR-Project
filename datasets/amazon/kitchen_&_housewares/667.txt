 The first time I used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken I thought that it was my technique.  After reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter, I tried another batch using the Rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter.  The results were the same:  no thickening, just liquid.  
 Others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture I received was not properly stored at some point before I received it or that it was just a bum lot
