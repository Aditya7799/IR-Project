 I recently ordered a Pedrini Black & Satin Stainless steel Tomato Slicer through Amazon.com. The delivery was very prompt.  
 The slicer came with a clear plastic cover for the blades.  But the problem is that the tomato slicer is very dull.  The tomatoes are literally torn up by the time they are completely sliced.  I would not order another one by Pedrini.  I am not pleased at all with my purchase
