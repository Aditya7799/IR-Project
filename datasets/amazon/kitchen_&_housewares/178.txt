 I, too, bought this terrible piece of equipment. My complaint, aside from the odd taste, consistency and smell, was that you could not tell when the egg was done. It was still raw at 10 minutes. By the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball. What a waste of money. As far as thinking up other purposes for it, I suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something.  You'll have to think of something, just don't put eggs in it
