 This has been used twice.  The first time I used it, it made a great smoothie.  I tried to use it this past Independence day and the "pulse" stopped and started continuously.  After a while, something smelled like it was burning.  On the bottom, there appears to be lots of specks of metal.  Don't think I'll be buying a new one
