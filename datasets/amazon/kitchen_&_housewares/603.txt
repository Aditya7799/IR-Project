 I was very unhappy with this product.  I ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use!!!  I did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner.  The people at Foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under "warranty" but I am surprised to see how fragile this product is.  FYI, they will not warranty the products sold on E-Bay.  I should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product.
