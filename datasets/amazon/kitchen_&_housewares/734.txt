 I must begin by saying my kitchen is 100% KitchenAid in Empire Red. I adore their gadgets and utencils...and then I came across this egg slicer.
 
 A good egg slicer is hard to find, and to find one matching my set..needless to say I was excited. But the first time I tried it, the wires simply popped out. It takes very little pressure to slice a hardboiled egg, but this poor slicer couldn't take it
 
 I am very surprised, considering the high quality of the other products that I own. I am on a hunt for another red egg slicer
