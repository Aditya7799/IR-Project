 I bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos.  I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke.  It is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug.  I was very disappointed since I use it every morning but thought it would last longer.  I will look for a better quality one next time
