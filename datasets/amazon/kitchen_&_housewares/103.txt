 At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so, it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better, but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use, the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it, but it just won't go in reverse. Overall, this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY
