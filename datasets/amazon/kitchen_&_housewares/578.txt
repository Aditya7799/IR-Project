 Maybe I just have stains that are too much for it, but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much, certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners. And I'm not using it on very old Le Creuset either, everything I have is less than a year old. Maybe it does better on older stains!
