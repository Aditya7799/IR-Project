 I've been using a large Cusinart for over 10 years.  It is marvelous, so I decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs.
 
 WRONG IDEA!!  This is a horrible little machine.  It won't grind more than a couple of seeds at a time & forget chopping!  The grinding unit won't rotate most of the time.
   
 It's going to the Salvation Army as a donation.
