 We have not been able to use the sheets because they are so stiff and rough.  They are wrinkled and no matter how many times they are washed they do not soften.  The pillowcases are too narrow for our regular size pillows which makes the pillows too high and hard to be comfortable. We are totally dissatisfied and thoroughly disappointed and will be returning them if for no other reason than to get them out of the house.  We do like the color, though
