 I was looking for a springform pan for a particular recipe that called for 3&quot; sides.  I was delighted when I saw that you had one so I ordered it. The item was misrepresented as the sides are like any other springform with 2&quot; sides.  I am sure it is a good pan , but it didnot meet my expectations
