 Firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken.  Amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one.  I now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile.  It's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them I'll be looking for something a bit more durable
