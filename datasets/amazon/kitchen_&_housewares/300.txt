 I bought this item on sale at Shopko, where it will be returned today.  I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.  
 
 If this isn't enough to deter you keep in mind that the "heavy cream" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price.  I paid $2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  That price doesn't even include the other ingredients listed.  
 
 Buyer Beware
