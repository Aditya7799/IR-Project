 I, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all
