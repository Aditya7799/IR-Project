 This product is a disgrace. Nonstick is not one of its virtues, and those who are thinking of purchasing this waste of money should be forewarned. It is not even well designed for broiling with small openings for fat drainage that quickly clog up. I am honestly surprised that Amazon would allow such an unworthy product to be sold under its banner
