 I am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan.  I bought this pan last week.  I fried bacon it on medium heat (as advised by salesperson).  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on medium heat.  Eggs stuck.  Ok, must be my fault--try low heat.  I fried bacon on low heat.  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on low heat.  Eggs stuck.  Pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap (as the instructions advise).  I promptly returned the pan and got a non-stick.  My life is much better.  Do NOT be fooled by the pan's good looks.  Think its just me?  My wife's sister bought the same pan.  Her report: everything sticks.  My sister has the pan.  She hates it!  Guess what?  Everything sticks.  How can a product be so popular and perform so aweful?  You are hereby on notice.
