 The unique design of this dinnerware line is lost in the low quality earthenware body.  This low fired clay body breaks easily, is bulky to handle and is just plain disappointing.  Before you buy, beware.  What is the dinnerware made of?  If the dinnerware is not high fire stoneware, porcelain or a china clay body, forget it.  If you plan to use it then you are wasting your money.  Someone should be ashamed
