 I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.
 
 Cuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them.  My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them.
