 I've owned Black and Decker's predecessor to this unit - the ShortCut - for about 25 years.  It was a well designed Mini food processor.  So I had high hopes for the Black & Decker MFP200 MiniPro Plus Food Processor.  What a disappointment!
 
 The problem is slicing.  The slicing disk *MUST* be used in conjunction with a "redirection disk" that redirects whatever your slicing out the "ejection chute".  Well this chute ejects alrighty - all over the kitchen.
 
 It goes back to Target tomorrow.  And to the design folks over at B & D: you should really test out your designs before going to production with them.
 
 Do yourself a *HUGE* favor and pass on this unit.
 
 I have to go now; I have mushroom slices all over my kitchen.
