 This unit from Cooking.com is made from China.  Consider it to be a disposable unit.  The threads on it are worthless.  I got one single use out of them.  I thought it to be a fluke.  Ordered another one.  Same thing.  Frustrated!  
 I located a German Made Cast Iron Rosette Iron online, from another reviewer.  There is a world of differences, between the $10.00 China junk knockoff and the German made one.  It is my opinion that the German Rosette Iron is worth every penny!  The German Made Cast Iron Rosette will no doubt be handed down for generations to come.  The threads alone are worth the higher price; however the quality is significantly noticeable.  The German made set is a much heavier set than the China made set from Cooking.com.  It is my opinion that it is worth your time to do a bit more research than for settling for this Chinese knockoff.  Don't get me wrong - they are still better than Aluminum any day of the week - but if you have ever owned an Alfred Andresen & Co Cast Iron Rosette set - you'll instantly know what I am talking about.
