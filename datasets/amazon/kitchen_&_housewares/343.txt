 The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips. I've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years. At last count, there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup. That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day.
