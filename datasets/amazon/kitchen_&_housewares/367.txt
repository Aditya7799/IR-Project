 There is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed.  There is no way to get out the wrinkles, other than by ironing them.  Otherwise, they are fine.  But who in the world wants wrinkled sheets!  You should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet.  These sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed.  I cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line
