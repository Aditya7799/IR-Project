 I received this saute pan for Xmas.  I have other Caphalon (no-stick) pans and was delighted, based on claimed attributes of their top-of-line pan.  However, my pan did not have a flat bottom which is a problem on an electric range. I returned to Caphalon and hav'nt heard a thing. I tired to claim lost but ups has proof of delivery - I would like to get a known reliable brand. I dislike poor products, am extremly disappointed with the service and total inconvience of the warranty program.
