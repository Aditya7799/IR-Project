 And bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks
