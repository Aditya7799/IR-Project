 Took the blender out of the box. Cleaned the jar and lid and started trying to use.  It ran for a few seconds and then I started smelling something burning and the blender quit.  I attempted to contact customer support and couldn't get through.  The telephone message suggested I leave a message and they would call back.  I attempted to leave a message but it said the mailbox was full.  Not a good sign
