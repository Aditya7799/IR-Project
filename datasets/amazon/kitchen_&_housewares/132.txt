 I thought it was me but every time that I lift the cover on this oven, there is this strange rotting smell.  It doesn't seem to matter what has been in there, either.  No matter what food...same rotting smell.
 
 In fact, whenever I lift the cover, my wife goes running from the room holding her nose, screaming about how disgusting it is.
