 I would have given this no stars but it won't let me. This non-stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape.  It is simply the worst product I have purchased in a long time.  I have this "non-Stick" griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash.  The non-stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless, it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds.  Don't buy it!!! If you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like I did before it met the old trash can
