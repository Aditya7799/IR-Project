 I received the Delonghi deep fryer on Friday evening and had it at the post office on Monday morning.  I did everything EXCEPT stand on my head to get it to make potato chips...smaller batches, larger batches, shorter cooking times, longer cooking times.  What I did get, consistantly, resembled more a potato cake which was soggy in the middle.  I bought a Waring Pro at William Sonoma for $40 more and had beautiful potatos Monday evening.  Bottom line...Delonghi may be a bit cheaper and a tad easier to clean, but I want good tasting food
