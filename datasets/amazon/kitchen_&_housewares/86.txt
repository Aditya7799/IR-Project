 Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice ("rice cooker cup")than it does for the water ("regular measuring cup"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.
 Yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into "warm" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don't realize it's done and its left on "warm" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.
 It seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. 
 
 Others' experience may vary. Keep in mind I'm very good at ruining rice. I just don't need help doing it!
