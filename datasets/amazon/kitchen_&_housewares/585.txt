 After reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them, I went ahead and ordered this rice cooker.  After I received the cooker, I was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china, rather than japan, and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish.  
 
 I made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot, and wash the pot and lid thoroughly, but upon trying it out I was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment.  It was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell.  The smell also flavored the rice, which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment. Aside from this problem, though, the rice, which was standard japanese style white short grain, came out perfectly.
 
 I returned this cooker and ordered the Panasonic SR-NA18, which should arrive tomorrow.  I have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store, and this Panasonic model seems better built than the newer (I believe) Panasonic SR-LA18, plus I believe it is made in Japan (I'll have to check when mine arrives).  I also highly recommend the Zojirushi 10-cup "Neuro Fuzzy" model (NS-JCC18/NS-ZCC18).  My parents have had one for several years and it works perfectly
