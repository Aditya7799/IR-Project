 I got this with my food saver.   It cracked in just a few uses.   I'm not pleased with Jardian either.   I was injured and can't talk when I tried to turn in a complaint by Email.   They said I needed to get a friend or family member to call them on the phone in order to get help.   What ever happened to equal access for the handicapped?    Maybe we handicapped should take our business elsewhere
