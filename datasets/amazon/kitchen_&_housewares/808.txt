 We never even plugged this sucker in.  I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that.  What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this "countertop" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard.  Don't most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them?  Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8".  I'm sending this monster back and getting something smaller
