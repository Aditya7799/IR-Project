 I have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off, causing it to continually leak. Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.
 
 Overall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things. 
 
 As a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through. 
 
 As a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn't allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice.
 On the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall
