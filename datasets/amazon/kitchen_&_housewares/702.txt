 The tumbler that I have is sold in various places as the '360-degree Dribble-Proof Tumbler', I am not sure if that is the same as the JMT401 but on paper the specs and features are the same.  It is not a good design for car use.  On the plus side I like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders.  On the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed.  Also the 'dribble-proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip, and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing
