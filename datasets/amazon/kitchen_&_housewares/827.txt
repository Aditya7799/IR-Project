 The Cuisinart egg cooker:
 - over/under cook the eggs according to its measuring cup
 - plastic tray deforms after it's heated (and stays deformed)
 - the metal cover burns your hand
 - is $10 more expensive than the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker, which is a much better product than Cuisinar
