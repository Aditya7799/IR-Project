 I had been looking for egg rings (without knowing what such a thing was actually called) for a long time before I happened upon these babies.  As soon as I saw them I knew they were exactly what I had been looking for and ordered them on the spot.  Unfortunately, my glee turned sour when I tried to use my new egg rings.
 
 A lot of people report they haven't had a problem with sticking, but that is not consistant with my experience.  Eggs stick to virtually everything, and these rings are no exception.  Trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain, usually I flip the ring and the egg flips with it, and then I have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan
