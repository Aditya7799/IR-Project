 I was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper.  I thought it would be ideal for hummus, which I hate to scrape out of my blender.  However, it was very disappointing.  On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped.  If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no?  I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped.  I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping.  I never had to take the top off of it.  Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs.  Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!
