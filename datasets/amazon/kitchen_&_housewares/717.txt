 I bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that I had previously owned. The "powerbrush" just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time. The prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier.
 Also the suction is lousy compaired to the old cordless version. Once the spot is wet and loosened there is not sufficient suction to pick up the water.
 I'm sorry I bought this product. It does a very poor job
