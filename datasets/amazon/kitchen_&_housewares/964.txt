 These are substandard thin towels.  They are cheap.  The current price is far too much to pay, and they should be about a buck each.
 
 They are terrible in dealing with liquid because they are so thin.
 
 I find the pictures here deceptive...there is nothing here that you can't find in your grocery store cheaper.
