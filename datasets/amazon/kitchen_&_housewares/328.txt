 I bought this coffee maker, because some people gave it high recommendation here. I think I wasted my money.
 It worked only for a couple of days. Finally, it just stopped working and I had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee. That is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above. It makes me feel that this Japanese coffee maker is like Sony-made products, having a fancy looking but lousy quality.
 Save your money for some other coffe makers, and avoid this one
