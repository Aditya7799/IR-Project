 I have bought flannel sheets from Amazon before but they were from Martex and they were greate. But, these are just bad. They are too thin to start with, left lint all over the bed and even after washing they have left fuzzies all over the sheets, I cannot even explain how bad it is. I  should have waited for another Martex deal
