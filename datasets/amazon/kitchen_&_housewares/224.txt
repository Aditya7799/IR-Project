 I splurged on this pan because I was tired of the &quot;wobble&quot; my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop. This pan warped severely after only 4 months, not any better than pans a fraction of the cost. I plan on returning it for replacement, and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only
