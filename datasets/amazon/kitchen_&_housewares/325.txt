 At first we loved this pan.  We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven.  I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan.  I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment
