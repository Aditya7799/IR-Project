 I purchased the Robinson Pyrex Candy Thermometer as a replacement for my old, cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings.
 My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.  
 
 Additionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is.  This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical.  
 
 The physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless.  It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying.  
 
 All said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson's Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up.
 
 Use a cup of ice water.  Or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer.  It's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results
