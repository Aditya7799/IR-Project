 Cuisinart does not stand behind their products. We purchased a 10 pc set and after using the 1 ï¿½ qt pan only once it formed a bubble on the bottom of the pan causing the pan not to lay flat on the stove. This actually renders the pan useless as it does not evenly disperse the heat and takes forever to even heat up.
 
 Upon notifying Cuisinart of the problem this is the response we got:
 
  "Thank you for your reply.
  
 The cookware does have a limited lifetime warranty against any
 manufacturing defects. However, if the pot has been over heated or damaged
 in any way it would not be covered under warranty.  You may send the item
 into us for an evaluation. You may send it to the following address listed
 below, with a check or money order for $7.00 return shipping and we will
 evaluate the cookware for you:
  
 Cuisinart Corporation
 150 Milford Road
 East Windsor, NJ 08520
 Thank you for your use and interest in Cuisinart products.
  
 Very truly yours,
 Ann Marie
 Cuisinart Representative"
 
 
 
 Why should I have to pay for shipping their defective product?The cost of shipping the product just to have it "evaluated" makes it a wiser choice to just forget the warranty and buy a new one. However the wisest choice would be to steer clear of this company's products altogether. By the way the pan was only used to boil some eggs.
