 This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one. 
 
 It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer
