 I went to Amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems.  Yes, deLonghi makes a great product.  No, this is not one of them.  I have read the directions so often I have them memorized, and I can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit.  I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs.  I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews.  So...who else bought this unit from Costco?  Because if that is the problem I'll bet Costco will be all over deLonghi to fix it.  Until then, this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning, every day
