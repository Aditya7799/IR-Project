 I was really excited to get the aluminum foil out of the bottom of my oven when I found this product, however, it didn't last very long.
 
 After less than two months use in my gas oven, this liner turned white and brittle because the non-stick surface had baked off!  I have never baked above 425 degrees, so the claims that it will withstand 550 degrees are outlandish.  Don't waste your money
