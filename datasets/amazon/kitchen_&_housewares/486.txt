 The top portion of the freezer works great.  The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom.  The reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator. I don't put anything in that part that I'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures.  It's a disappoinment
