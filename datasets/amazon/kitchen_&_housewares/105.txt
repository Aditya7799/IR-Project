 I FOLLOWED BREAKIN INSTRUCTIONS AS WRITTEN ON PG 3.THE CLEAR SEE-THRU TOP WARPED.UNIT WORKS,BUT IS UGLY. I CONTACTED SALTON AND WAS TOLD MY UNIT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY,TOO OLD! I MAILED COPIES OF MY INVOICE. NO RESPONSE.I GAVE UP.I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR SERVICE,BUT WONDER IF DRIVING TO WALMART MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER.
                                    SINCERELY,
 
                                      JOHN C BENNET
