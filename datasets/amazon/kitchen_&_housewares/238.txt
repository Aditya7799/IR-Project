 I only used mine once, then tossed it. Wish I would have read these reviews first!  Thought it looked good at Kohls.  I liked that the grates can be seperated to wash... they do, but it takes a lot of force.  Feels like you're going to break them. I should have returned it but I was mad at it and trashed it.. at least it was marked 15% off (still higher than here though).
 
 I've been trying to find one like we have. A simple one with a handle.  No plastic. I feel they work the best.  I think it's an Ecko, but I can't find it anywhere.  Target and walmart don't have it
