 I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present.  It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day.  Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big).  That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan.  It's considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle.  Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks!  Phooey to you, Le Creuset.
 
 I wish I could find another glass lidded Joyce Chen wok - my old one was the best, before it was dropped one too many times
