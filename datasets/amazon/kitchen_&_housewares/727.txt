 when this arrived I was very pleased with its quality-color-packaging -everything.Only problems is that after a short time using the plates I noticed scratch marks-dark ones in the center of the plates-I would guess from where people used their dinner knives to cut their food--very disappointing-as I was ready to buy the entire collection-glad i waited.
