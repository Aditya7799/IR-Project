 I got this on sale from Targets for $35.  Eagerly I plugged in the unit, turned the variable dial to maximum steam, and increased the digital dial to  7.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited, for 10 minutes.  The iron never warmed up, let alone hot enough to iron anything.  I can't say this is a bad product, but surely I got a non-working unit
