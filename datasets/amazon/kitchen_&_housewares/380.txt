 I have had this pan for a year. I bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set. I figured it would be a good test run on the Circulon brand. It grills great,but you will spend  twice the cooking time cleaning the pan! I could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it. You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it
