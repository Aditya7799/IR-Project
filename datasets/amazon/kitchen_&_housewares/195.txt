 Inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays, one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse. Each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device. After only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked. After about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
