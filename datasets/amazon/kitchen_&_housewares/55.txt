 I felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set. The grill cover started to desapair, and the last time I cooked a stek using this set, the paint sticked to the meat, leaving black spots. It started to show deteriorazion and everytime I washed I have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon.
 The deep pan it is ok, perhaps because I did not used that piece with the same frequency.
 I never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning, I always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning, to avoid scratches.
 Thank you for your attention
