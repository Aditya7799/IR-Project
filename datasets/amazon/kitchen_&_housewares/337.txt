 Less than one month after puchasing this pasta machine all of the pasta dies have broken.  The ring nuts cannot hold the dies in place and they break.  Maybe it is because I was making semolina pasta, but that should not be the case.  This machine has caused me way too much stress at dinner time.    Knowing what I know now I would buy fresh pasta at the store
