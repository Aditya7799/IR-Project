 The information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose DOES NOT fit Hoovers with a HEPA system.  It only fits Hoovers with product #'s beginning U53.., U54.., U64..  I ordered it along with a new Windtunnel that has a Hepa system, since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people.  Unfortunately, it does not state that these people (now including me) have to return the hose because it does not fit all Windtunnels.  So be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy.  ..
