 Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds.  In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work.  Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself.
