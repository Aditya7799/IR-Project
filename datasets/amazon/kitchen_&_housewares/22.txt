 Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment.
