 I purchased the Melitta Mill in April, it's now July and the thing is shot.  We used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee, first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing.  Sure it was inexpensive, but you should get more than three months out of the purchase.  $6+ a month just to grind coffee?  Don't buy this poorly constructed product.
