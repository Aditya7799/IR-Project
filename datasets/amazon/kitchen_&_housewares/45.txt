 I just got one of these nifty looking Canisters, but mine
 seems to spell out "Tea of Cowage" ! LOL..
 
 It seems the script of the u merged with the r and thus made a 'w'..
 There is no space between the lower case u and r.
 
 Too funny!
 
 Thanks Pfaltzgraff! Good production Quality Control! 
 
 If I could post a picture of it here in this review I Would! 
 
 Edit: I did get a second one of these shipped from Amazon, and that one also had the misspelling.
 Will someone who has purchased one of these recently Please post a review and mention if this product Still says "Tea Of Cowage"?
 THANKS
