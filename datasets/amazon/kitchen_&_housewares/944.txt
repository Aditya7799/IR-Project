 Well, I can't say that I didn't like this thing at first.  It came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds.  At first it seems like a nice little unit.  I poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing.  I say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use (filterless of course).  After a few uses, I noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly.  If you want your coffee now and have no time to pour, don't get this item.  After having this machine for 3 weeks now, and using it constantly every morning, I have finally decided that it is near total crap.  I just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air &amp; water which caused the grinds blow all over the place.  Spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter.  How nice.  If you're going to buy a cheap coffee maker, spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi-decent one.  Toastmaster should stick to toasting.  If you do decided to get this, buy some towels and a mop as well
