 I thought it was a good deal to order a "Factory-Reconditioned" Roomba 4210 Discovery to save some money, however...
 
 It arrived!  I excitedly opened the box.  First impression...  The unit was dirty, very heavily scatched and scuffed.  Not exactly a good first impression.
 
 I then lifted the Roomba out of the box and I was immediately covered with dirt and dust.  The bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair.  I flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt, dust and someones (or somethings!) hair.
 
 I was grossed out, but even worse, the other person in the room (who suffers from allergies) started to sneeze violently.  I spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces I could reach.
 
 I think it is very obvious that NOBODY did anything with this Roomba since the previous owner returned it besides transfer the polystyrene packing box to a new cardboard box that says "Remanufactured" on it!
 
 In summary - BE VERY CAREFUL!!!
 
 If you ordered a "Factory-Reconditioned", be aware that it might be pre-filled with someone elses dust, dirt, hair and who knows what else.
 
 I think I might have to bite the bullet and pay full price.  I like the idea of this product, but not the pre-filled one I received
