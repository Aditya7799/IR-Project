 The coffee maker was working fine as long as I was using the presto Mypods with no filter in them.. 
 
 Then, I tried using some pods in the regular pod holder. Coffee all over the counter every time.. I suspect that using the pods created back pressure that ruptured something internally. 
 
 Based on the fact then when used as intended it fails miserably, I would have to say that it is an example of shoddy engineering.. Junk, Garbage, Crud
 
 BTW - If yours is working, I found that the secret to decent tasting coffee was to wash the pod holder (the presto mypod) with soap and water every time and throw the pod holders in the dishwasher once in a while. 
 
 I guess they let some three year olds design the thing on a 'take your kids to work' day.
