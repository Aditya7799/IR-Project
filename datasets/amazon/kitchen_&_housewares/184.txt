 I was so excited to receive my DeLonghi Caffe Sorrento Bar4 4-Cup Espresso/Cappuccino Machine.
 Being an experienced expresso drinker I started to brew my expresso, needless to say the frother works so so good you do not even have to turn it on.  Water and steam everywhere, also the frother does not turn off, I tried so hard that the knob came off.  I was very dissapointed
