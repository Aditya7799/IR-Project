 I bought this item in October 2005, by January it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher. I contacted both Amazon and Emile Henry about it.  Amazon will only give a partial refund and Emile Henry told me to go through the merchant and DID NOT offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product.  Don't buy this piece of junk
