 These bowls are wonderful - a great addition to my Winterberry collection, however they came packaged in the same packaging as they would in store, so during shipment they were broken.  Amazon was great to send replacements, but some of those were broken too.  I have finally received all dishes I ordered, but beware of receiving broken dishes
