 Mine died after 6 months - half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread.  Took it apart - no loose or broken wires, so must have been the circuitry.  Chucked it in the garbage.
 While it was working, it would jam easily.  The push-down handle has a flimsy metal tang that twists easily (when kids or oafish adults use it).  The tang then rubs against the slot, incinerating the toast
