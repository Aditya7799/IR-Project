 Considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself,(all excessive, by the way) the carafes have much to be desired.  It seems as if they are made with spun sugar.  EXTREMELY FRAGILE, awkward handle and like a comment already listed, I too have replaced the carafe twice...making three so far.  My Krups carafe of 10 years is still intact.  If they still made the filters, I would still be using that machine.
 The Cuisinart coffee bean container is hard to clean, still maintains rancid oils and leaves an oil slick on the top of the coffee.  The carafe is poor at best
