 I have had the blue ecopods for well over a year now. Ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean. 
 
  I saw the Presto MyPod and leaped to try it. The coffee overfills the cup making it too weak and no room for creamer.  There is absolutely no foam. I got hooked on the Senseo Foam.  We will use it in a pinch but only on the 1 cup setting with 1 1/2 scoops
