 to begin with..  
 this pan heats up even and fast. i have a hard anodized circulon non-stick pot, a copper bottom skillet, and this calphalon pan. the heat distribution is excellent, and unlike the copper bottom pan, the calphalon is light and easy to use. 
 
 BUT, the good stops here. the stick problem is bad, and my stainless steel copper bottom pan sticks less than this calphalon skillet. 
 
 since it's not a non-stick pan, some sticking is expected, but clean up is just pain. regular soaking over nite will NOT help sometimes. 
 
 if u cook vegitable and small amount of meat, this pan is good. but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan. avoid anything that will carmalize or contain high sugar. 
 
 i once cooked some balsamic vinegar mushroom with brown sugar in this pan, and it took me forever to get it clean again since the sugar carmalization litterally stuck to the bottom.
