 This pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread.  For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
