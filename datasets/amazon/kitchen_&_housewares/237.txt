 I bought one of these to make Bagna Cauda, and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the "high" button, it sparked and died. Well, ok, I guess it only *half* died, as the "pulse" button would still work, if I leaned on it with my entire weight, but both the "high" and "low" switch settings did nothing. So I'm thinking next time I'll spend a little more; meanwhile, this little guy goes back
