 Be careful to buy products from compact appliance. They will not be responsible if the product is defective from the manufacturer. There is no return. You better think more than twice before you buy from compact appliance. They have the worst customer service including the manufacturer Edgestar.
 I agreed completely with the previous customer review that it is hard to get in touch with Edgestar customer service, which has the worst product I ever bought.
