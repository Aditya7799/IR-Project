 I've used these type of units all the time until I got my own.  It stopped sealing, and I haven't had a chance to use up the bags that came with it!  When I called, they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they can't fix it.  They offered to sell me a new one though!  I have no idea where my receipt is (my fault).  I have to have another one, so I'm going to buy the cheapest one so I don't feel so bad when I have to replace it in 6 months to a year
