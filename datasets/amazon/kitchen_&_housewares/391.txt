 Bought this item last Christmas for my wife. Worked fine until this Thanksgiving when rubber bulb split apart when basting turkey. She had complained when I bought this fancy one to replace her old ugly plastic one last year but I insisted this was better. Boy am I in trouble now. Old plastic one had lasted for 10 years and cost 1/10 as much. Did not look like much but it did the job
