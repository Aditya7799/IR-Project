 We had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead.  The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic.  We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year.  We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil.  While the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and Bar Keeper's Friend, I'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it
