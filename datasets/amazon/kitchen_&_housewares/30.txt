 The International Eversharp line is Henckels low-end, stamped stainless line.  It is not carbon steel. It is not hand-forged.  It does not compare to the other Henckels lines which are.  You get what you pay for.  These are cheap knives.
 
 This is the first time I have seen a set of Henckels knives which could go in the dishwasher....but, that's because on this line, you do not get Henckels lifetime warranty (which is voided by dishwasher use)
