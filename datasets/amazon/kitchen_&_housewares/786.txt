 We liked the idea that the caraffe didn't need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit.  But.... we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter.  A FLOOD of coffee.  We thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged... so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them.  But then we had a flood again on the counter.  So we thought that maybe our filters were'nt good... so we bought other ones.  And them we had another big flood of coffee (this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting).  So we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight.... so we ground it coarser... and yet, ANOTHER DANG FLOOD. We have followed the instructions perfectly... and still these overflows.
 
 So now we are ticked... we have never had this headache with a coffee maker before.... and all we want is some coffee in the morning.  So we're going to try and return the stupid thing (our reciept and box are long gone). Sure hope we can get an exchange... and certainly NOT another one of these.
 
 Oh... and the mugs that come with it don't have handles on them like the ones in the picture do
