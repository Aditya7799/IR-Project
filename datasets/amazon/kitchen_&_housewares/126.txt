 I used this press about 4-5 times during the 5 years I owned it.  The cookie shapes came out well, but after a few uses, the plastic ring around the barrel cracked.  This year that same plastic part broke entirely, making the press unusable-- a critical engineering materials defect.  Like the other reviewer (Dec 2005), I too am now in the market for an all metal press
