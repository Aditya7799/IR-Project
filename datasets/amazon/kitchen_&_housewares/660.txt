 Works well and looks great but lifting is not fun.  If you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle.  
 
 This stainless WK600 one is listed at 6.4 lbs, and the white plastic WK200 is listed at 2.9 lbs.  A big difference!  The stainless one weighs empty close to what the plastic one weighs full.  With a minimum fill of 1/2 liter The stainless weighs in at 7.4 lbs. and the plastic at 4.0 lbs.  
 
 I'm returning my stainless WK600 unit and ordering the WK200 plastic one.
