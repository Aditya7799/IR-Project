 Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).
 
 I will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss.  But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done.
