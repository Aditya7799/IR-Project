 This kettle has so many design flaws I don't know where to start.  It doesn't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back.  The spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup.  The shape (especially the angle) of the handle means that it gets very hot -- I can't hold it without a pot holder -- and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water.  Mine also already started rust on the outside.
 I purchased this kettle about six months ago and I'm going to have to now buy another one
