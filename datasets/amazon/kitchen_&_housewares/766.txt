 This carafe keeps beverages warm enough.  The problem I'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position.  The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid.  Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks.  To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience.
