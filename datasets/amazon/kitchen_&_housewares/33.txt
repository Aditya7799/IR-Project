 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.  
 
 Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware
