 No.  The product is not very durable
 
 
 Good things:
 All in all, this caddy is great because it's versatile. It's huge and tall enough so a 12.5" round cake that's about 5 inches high can fit in easily. The locking mechanism is also pretty neat. There's 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor. The handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip.  Carrier is also see through so you'll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process.
 
 NOT so Good things:
 NOT very durable. Locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable.
 This product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that's only my assumption. Plastic should not crack unless it's placed in extreme temperatures or is abused. Should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic? Very unlikely don't you think?
 The price is also far cry compared to other products sold by discount stores (i.e Linens../WlMrt. Other carriers are sold from $4-$9.
 
 The height is good but it can be problematic when storing it in the fridge, but aren't all cakes difficult to store regardless?
 
 In terms of cleaning the base, you'll need a brush to really get the bottom cleaned up
