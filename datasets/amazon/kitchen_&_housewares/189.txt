 I bought this thinking I would be able to regulate the size, (I have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works), to say it is loud is an understatement, & 1st thing in the AM.  I had it about 2 weeks, when I noticed it was hot to the touch, and it no longer worked, mind you I had not used it in 2 days, and had moved it to clean.  I have not contacted them at this point, but do not want a replacement, and a part of me is glad it broke, so I don't have to listen to the noise anymore
