 My knives started to rust after 3wks of use.  I didn't put them in the dishwasher either.  I just leave them in the sink w/the dirty dishes till I'm ready to wash.  But that shouldn't be the problem.  I have a cheap $3 butcher's knife from chinatown that hasn't rusted yet and I treat that one the same
