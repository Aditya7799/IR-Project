 I purchased this knife, and when it arrived, the package said, "Not recommended for left-handers."  If Henckels chooses to design only for right-handed people, that's their right, but they should disclose it clearly.  Second, [Amazon.com] should include such information in their editorial review.  I'm left-handed, and I'll add this to my can opener and vegetable peeler as one-way kitchen gadgets
