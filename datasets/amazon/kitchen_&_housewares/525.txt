 I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk.  I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job.  All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom.  So, you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated.  And then try adding the crushed ice.  This blender is going back.
 
 If you need a blender to make smoothies, this is not the model to buy
