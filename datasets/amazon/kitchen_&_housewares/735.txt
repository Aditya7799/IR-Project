 I bought one of these because I think that the idea of a slicer is good.  Supposed to work with soft cheese, eggs, mushrooms and other soft items.
 
 The first time I used it I decided to try it with mushrooms and on the third mushroom the cutting wires broke.  I would have returned it but for the price didn't think it was worth the trouble.  So I just tossed it.  Maybe mine was defective but I doubt it
