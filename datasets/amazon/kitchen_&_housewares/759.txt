 Well, it started off a fairytale.  This small vacuum has a lot of power.  Unfortunatley, I think I have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum.  It is EXTREMELY loud, it terrified my pets and I had ringing in my ears after using it.  It worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me.  I'm not sure if the motor gave out or what, but the suction doesn't work even though the brushes still spin.  THE FILTER IS A PAIN!  I run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair, it just clogs up way to fast.  If you have a small apartment with merely area rugs, this might be ok, just make sure you buy some ear plugs.  YIKES.
