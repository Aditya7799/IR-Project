 Like the other reviewers, I followed the instructions for this machine to the letter.  I froze the canister in my deep-freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it.  Although the recipe provided was quite tasty, even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage, let alone ice cream.  My kids pretty much drank it from the bowl.  It's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes; no way.  Returned it the next day (and paid for shipping)
