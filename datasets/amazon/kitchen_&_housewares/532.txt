 For approximately six months I owned this knife.  I used it everyday as it far outshined my other henkel chefs knife in balance, cutting efficiency and need for regular sharpening.  Until a few weeks ago when I was peeling a clove of garlic with the knife.  Lo and behold...I know have a two inch blade attached to the handle and five inches of steel sitting on the countertop.  I am currently looking for other brands of this knife style as I was unhappy with the manufactures complete lack of response regarding my complaint
