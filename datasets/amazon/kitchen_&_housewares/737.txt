 We like the features and performance of this oven quite a bit.  We bought it to replace a regular old toaster oven.  The T-Fal toasts very evenly and I can fit a whole frozen pizza in it!
 
 The bad part is that after about 2 weeks of service, the controls work only very intermittently.  This means that all functions behave at their default settings--no temperature or time adjustments.  Luckily, the default setting for toast is just barely on the brown side for us, still edible.  It's annoying to have what is otherwise a fine oven so befouled by unusable controls.  It would have received a 5.
