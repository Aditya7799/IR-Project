 I was so excited when i found a contemporary stainless pattern to add to my gift registry.  When i received the 20 piece set at a shower I was very ecited until I washed them and never got to eat off them because they RUST!!!!  I called gourmet settings and they are sending me another set but I am removing the 45 piece set from my registry.  I will use them for picnic silverware not dining roon silverware
