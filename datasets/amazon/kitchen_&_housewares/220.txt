 I've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings.  It too broke within 2 days of use.  These plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses, or by someone who has a strong grip.  The common defect I'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum.  The tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum.
 
 When I find a good rotary cheese grater, I'll write a review on it
