 cThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.
 
 Cuisinart's one has obviously some problems:
  1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard.
  2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio.
  3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts.
  4. Some basic cycle have no "Pre-heat" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail.
  5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula.
 
 One of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things:
  1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful.
  2. "Pre heat" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more.
  3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer.
 
 I think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker.
