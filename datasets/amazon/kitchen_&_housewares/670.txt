 I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind & Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON.
