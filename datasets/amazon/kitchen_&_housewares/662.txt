 What A JOKE!!! This whas a disappointing experience. The Garment Steamer never really worked. I wasted a valuable time in this deal. I bought one at target first missing parts then I went back returned it and came back home to use it and again never worked. What a WASTE of my time! The second GARMENT STEAMER ONE and OFF button kept turning off about one minute never producing any steam. I tried to contact customer service to find out if I was using it right and customer sevice is no HELP AT ALL! MY ADVISE IS: PLEASE DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT. Sincerely,&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;&#60;br /&#62;
