 I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star.
