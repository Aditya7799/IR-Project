 I bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust.  Well, sure enough, rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher.  The rust spots were small, but I returned the set anyways, as I am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others.
 
 And just for the record, I did not use lemon detergent, and I only allowed the set to stay in the dishwasher a short while after the cycle completed.  This set is at best a high maintenance proposition.  Hand washing and drying is not for me!  
 
 Its a shame, because the set really is beautiful
