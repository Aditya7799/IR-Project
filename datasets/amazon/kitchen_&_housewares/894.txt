 The 4-cup coffee press is in actuality just 2 cups. The number of ounces is not listed in the sales blurb... What we wanted was 4 cups at 8 ounces each. The 4-cup coffee press is just a bit over 16 ounces. While it says so on the lid of the box it came in, the ounce-capacity is not in the Amazon listing. ...So we returned it..
