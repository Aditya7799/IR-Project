 Although this grill has all the design elements I wanted - easy to use, quick to clean, and very compact, it is very cheaply made.  After just 3 uses, One of the joints that adheres the top to the bottom broke.  Had I not reacted quickly, I would have been burned.  We were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it.
 
 Upon close examination, we found the weak joint to be made of some sort of brittle, composite material, NOT metal.  It's such a disappointment to see such a terrific design implemented so poorly.
