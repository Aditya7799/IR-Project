 I thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor.  I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side.  I returned the product and received a full refund.  The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people
