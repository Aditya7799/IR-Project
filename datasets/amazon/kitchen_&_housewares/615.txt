 The blade broke after 14 months of use.  And to take advantage of the warranty, I learned that I was required to send THEM a check for $4.00 for processing costs, not to mention the cost that I would incurr to ship it to them.  It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place).  I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this.  Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust.  I'm very disappointed
