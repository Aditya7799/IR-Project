 This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings
