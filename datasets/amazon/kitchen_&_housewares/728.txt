 I bought this because it had such good reviews... I got one and used it a few times perfectly without problems. until it blew up in the microwave. yep, BLEW up. Now Im sure i did everything as i was meant to.. so i really am being objective about this review..
 
 what can i say? this was my experience, ive decided to buy a more reliable egg cooker which does not involve the microwave..
