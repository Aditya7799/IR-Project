 This is our second George F grill.  The first one burned out after about 5 years.  We liked but could not get the same size so we got this one.  It was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!  After less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat (spade conn.) just fell apart.  Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it.  Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again.  This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled.  It is a piece of junk.  We will replace it with a different brand.  Thanks for nothing George
