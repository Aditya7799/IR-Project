 Received this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004.  From day one I was not very happy with it.  The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not.  About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial.  About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time.  Today the timer dial broke off completely.  So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it.  So, don't purchase this product, it is not worth it.
