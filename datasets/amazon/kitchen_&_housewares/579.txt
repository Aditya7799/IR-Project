 The size is nice for 2 people.  Cleaning is easy.  Seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself.  You have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right.
