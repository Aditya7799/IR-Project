 I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work.
