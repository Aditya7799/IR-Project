 I was so happy when I received this sheet set. It looks beautiful (that's the reason why I am still giving 1 star). But after a couple of nights of use the fitted sheet became ruff. THEY PILE!!!! If you are looking for comfort - as anybody who buys a 1000TC sheet set is - don't bather with these. Spend your hard earned money someplace else
