 I received the DeLonghi XR640 Toaster Oven and was disappointed to find it unuseable. The wire rack inside was such a tight fit, it took 2 hands to pull it out! After a few times doing this, the enamel finish was starting to come off, which would soon result in rusting metal. I never turned it on, just returned it immediately.
