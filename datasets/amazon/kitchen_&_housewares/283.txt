 I have a set of mid-range Henckels that I bought some years ago, and they are -much- better than this.  I bought this set for my daughter because they were a good compromise between quality and price, and she won't ruin then in the dishwasher.  I would have thought that Henckels wouldn't make any actual crap, but this set comes awfully close.  The good thing is, boy are they sharp.  But there's bad things too.  Only the 8" chef's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy.  'Laser-cut' edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction. A good knife is an extension of the cook's intention - it does what you want, and does NOT require thought and pre-conception and compensation in every cut. (...)is waaay too much for one adequate chef's knife and some toys.  Very disappointed in Henckels, and in Amazon too, I don't feel I got what I ordered.
