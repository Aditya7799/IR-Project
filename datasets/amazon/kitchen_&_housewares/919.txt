 The pad sent to me did not match the description or photo.  The neck on the pad is very narrow.  The photograph depicts a different type of ironing board than the one the cover actually fits.  I bought two of these and had to return them both as they did not fit the board.  I was stuck paying the shipping, thus penalizing me for a product that was misrepresented
