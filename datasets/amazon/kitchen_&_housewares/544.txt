 I just bought this toaster (not on Amazon) to replace a Black&Decker toaster oven that had served well for more than 10 years.  This new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze.  This is a very dangerous appliance that, based on my experience and other reviews here, should probably be taken off the market and recalled
