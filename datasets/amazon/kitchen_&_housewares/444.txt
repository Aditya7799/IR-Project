 I thought this was the answer to my crock-pot prayers!  I received it for Christmas and was heart broken to realize that you can choose high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10 hours.  (Look at the product image enlarged) Most things I cook take 6 hours on low!  I occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours.  Unfortunately, if it doesn't do the time you need, it is completely useless.  You would have to be home to turn it off or down.  So I returned it and am making do with my Select Brands corningware programmable, (it doesn't do 6 hours on low either) and a regular 3 quart.  I just make it home in time or I don't cook it
