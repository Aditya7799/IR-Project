 I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly.  I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange.  I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it.  The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than  to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer.  It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans. I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in, including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product.  Too unpredictible.
