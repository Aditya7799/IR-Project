 I had received this set for my Birthday from a friend.  When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior.  This made the non-stick aspect of the pot worthless.  I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out.  When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot.  I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say.  I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up.  In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non-stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily.  If you get the Calphalon One Infused-Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service.  Remember the old saying "you get what you pay for."  I don't think these non-stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use.  If you do choose to buy these pans examine them when you open the box for damage
