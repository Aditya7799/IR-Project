 This chopper, if you can call it that, is terrible.  I've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese.  I've tried filling up the bowl, half full and barely anything at all.  It doesn't chop.  Plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food.  I've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade.  Then, I'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again.  It started to chop a little a couple of times, but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing.
 It was horrible and I've opted now for a bigger 7 cup Kitchen Aid or Cuisinart processor based on reviews here.
 Lesson learned, you get what you pay for
