 I purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $7 each. The latest probe just malfunctioned.  I really loved it at first...perfectly roasted chickens,loin roasts, and turkeys.  Oddly enough, the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn't designed to handle much time in the oven.  If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable.  Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its' toll...it just takes longer for it to happen.  One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat.  I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working, it is great.  That is worth $7 a year for me....but not for everyone.  Per another reviewers advice, I am calling Polder
