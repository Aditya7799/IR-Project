 First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT"
