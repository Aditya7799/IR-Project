 Unfortunately, I've ordered more than my share of FoodSaver products, having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage,  despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers.
 
 What many of them claim is very much to the point: plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum.  I've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses.  It seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics.  The smaller containers seem to last longer. Those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer.
 
 In plain language, the plastic containers are unreliable.  FoodSaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them, or quit the the business.  Since their products have been on the market for many years, I can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers. If you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks, more power to you.
 
 Bottle sealers are equally worthless.  Every one that I bought lost vacuum in short order.  In one case, a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear.
 
 FoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line.  The vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably, as long as the instuctions are followed.  The bagging system is unassailable, even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high (read Consumer Reports reviews).  And, to be fair, their Universal lids are excellent.  Use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls, and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic.
 
 Bottom line?  Be careful which products you buy.  Some are excellent, while others are pure junk.
