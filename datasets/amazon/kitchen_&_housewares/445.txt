 I found this sealer to be difficult to use.  It is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle.  Extreme pressure is needed to hold down and lock the top in order to create the vacuum and seal the bag.  If you let up on the pressure, the vacuum seal is broken.  I returned mine and would never buy another Rival sealer product again
