 I wouldn't purchase anything from vision decour! I ordered this 3 piece set the same say I ordered pieces from three other companies. It took vision decour longer to just e-mail me than it did the other companies to ship and deliver the other three pieces I ordered. Apparently the set I ordered was out of stock, but vision decour neglected to update their web site. After they contacted me about this issue I checked their site and they still had the set listed as availabel and in stock. So now I have been waiting for weeks and have half of a living room with no prospect of getting the table set I needed to match everything else
