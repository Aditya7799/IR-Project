 We have had this toaster for approximately 3 yrs.  It has had mimimal use as we
 vacation away from home in the winter ( 4 months at least).  There are just two
 people using this toaster and on an average only  use it twice a week.  The toaster is
 a part time toaster, sometimes it will toast both sides sometimes not.  It has
 now become a total pain as the mechanism to hold the bread down has stopped
 working.   I thought that a Cuisinart would last for ever.  I owned a very cheap
 toaster for over 35 years, gave it to my sons to use in college.  That toaster still
 functions properly but is small and a 2 slicer.  It will come out of the attic until
 we can find a better company than Cuisinart with a better product
