 Bought the Machine, and got the correct flour.  Made up the dough, and that was a success.  Followed the instructions, used the vice to hold the machine to the table, then started off by cleaning the machine with a small piece of dough to get rid of machine oil.
 
 All that worked well.
 
 Then I started to make pasta.  Making the sheets was fine, but as soon as I cut them into noodles it all went wrong.  They started to stick together.  My wife and I ended up having to work together, flouring the noodles as they came out of the machine to stop them sticking.  
 
 But the pasta was delicious.  I guess it just takes a bit of practice.  In future I will leave the dough longer in the fridge to "rest" before rolling it, and have a mini-production line ready to catch and flour the cut noodles.
 
 The machine works great, I have no problems with it.  It is cheap, it may fall apart, but for this price who really cares?
 
 I can't wait to try making my own pasta tricolore.  And I want to try lasagne, ravioli and canneloni.  That way we can freeze our own pasta for easy re-heating.  Healthy TV dinners here we come
