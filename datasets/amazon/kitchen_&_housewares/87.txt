 I hardly ever write reviews but I felt the need to on this item. I bought the senseo deluxe last night, I wanted the deluxe model so that I could also make tea. The setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition. Here's the problem, I brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee EVER and I'm not even a big coffee drinker. To make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee. Who drinks only 4 ounces of anything. You would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak. Which is wear the waste of money comes in. The senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast. I personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning. I originally bought the Senseo because I didnt want to spend Tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get. Now the tassimo is great. I've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son. Everyone likes it. Good luck everyone.
