 I LOVE to grill but I keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment I had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter.  First, it took more than 1/2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other.  Secondly, and worst of all, on just my second attempt using it I was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to "HIGH".  I immediately went out to check it and the probe is DEAD!!!  There's no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer!!  Taylor is NO HELP!
