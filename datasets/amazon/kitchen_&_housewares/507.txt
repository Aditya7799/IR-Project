 I have two Roomba's, after one year of good operation they have been having battery problems.  One Roomba was returned for refurbishment.  They have good customer service, if you pursue them.  The newly returned Roomba still has battery problems.  The housekeeper which was very excited when I bought the Roomba now uses the vacuum cleaner.
