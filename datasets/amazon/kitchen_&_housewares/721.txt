 I'm surprised you requested this review because I returned the item.  They 
 were just what I wanted, color and all, but when I tried to put the dinner 
 plates in the dishwasher they only fit if I placed them using two spaces.
 This reduced the dishwasher capacity.  Next problem surfaced when the same
 dinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet
