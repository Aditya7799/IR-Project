 We registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first AND second box we picked up. It's a very attractive set; too bad it can't actually contain food due to broken corners, can't be washed in a dishwasher, can't be used on the stove, and can't be used to broil! You can't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee, which is why I wanted them. Additionally, Target doesn't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise. I realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too, but I just thought I'd point out that the Corningware doesn't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken
