 When I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.  That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money's worth.
 
 The positive review from America's Test Kitchen is what pointed me in this direction.  The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat.  All of the positive comments are accurate at first.
 
 The problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely.  I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat.  I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic.  I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface.
 
 I have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago.  With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly.  Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault.  Why waste $10 in shipping costs?  This is my last Farberware product.
 
 After writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond.  After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn't really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful.  BUYER BEWARE
