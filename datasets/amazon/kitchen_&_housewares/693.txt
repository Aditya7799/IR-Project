 Like most reviewers, I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist.  Like a number of other reviewers, I found that one of my glasses leaked.  Unlike one other reviewer, I was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave, and when I tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced.  To my mind, elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design.  5 stars for form, 1 star for function:  2 stars total.
 
 Addendum:  I liked the form of these glasses so much that I bought two more at my local coffee house, knowing that if either leaked I could easily return it.  Neither did, and they're a pleasure to use.  I recommend local, rather than web, purchase
