 I bought this juicer last week from a local store. It is impossible to keep it steady when you use it. You are luckY if you get the half of the juice in the glass!  The juice is all over the place. The unit started to make a loud noise after 2 days. I will return it this weekend and get my money back. STAY AWAY!
