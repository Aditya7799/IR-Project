 You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend.
