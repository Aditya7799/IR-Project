 I am sorry to say that I was not satisfied with this pan at all!  The cakes I bake are browning, even burning on the edges BEFORE the middle is even done!  The edges are rising but the middle is &quot;slumping&quot; down.  I own the Calphalon cookware and that is nice but they have a STINKER in their bakeware.  My recommendation= Look at a different pan
