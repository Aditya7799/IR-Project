 I like the solid construction but I also like strong coffee.  This machine does not "spray the entire filter basket". Instead, water dribbles out of a 2-inch diameter ring, leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle. I sent the first one back.  The replacement does the same thing.  KitchenAid customer service confirms that, despite the discription on Amazon, the unit does not spray the entire filter basket.  I'm sending the replacement back also. If you love strong coffee, don't buy this machine
