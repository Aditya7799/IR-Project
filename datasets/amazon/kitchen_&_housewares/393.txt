 I agree completely with the review by Terry Gruggen. As she said in her Feb review, 
 "the cutting arm is attached to this indestructible case by an all too flimsy piece of plastic. A little extra pressure on the arm and this plastic attachment shatters....leaving you with a $49 die cast paper weight."
 Despite its rugged looks, the appliance was a real disappointment
