   This is a very nice small oven, but as a toaster it really drives me up the wall. As someone else said, three knobs to adjust just to make toast! Then you have to stand there and watch it and the toast still burns!
   I will keep this to use as an oven, but tomorrow I am going out and buy a nice small toaster.
   And guess what it will not be an Oster product. This is the  last of their products I shall ever purchase.
