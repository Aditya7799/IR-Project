 I bought this "piece of junk" at Wal*Mart. I was actually surprised to see a food processor so cheap, so I decided to buy it.
 
 After going home and washing the product, I decided to try it out. I plugged it in and NOTHING. It didn't even budge!
 
 Anyway, I am going to have to drive ALL THE WAY back to Wal*Mart and return this...
 
 Save your money and go with a more expensive model that will last you..
