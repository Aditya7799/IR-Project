 The machine is easy to use and makes great espresso ... when it's working!Mine broke down within the first year.  I spent $80 dollars to fix it the first time, but it broke down again after another two months of use (water wouldn't heat up).  It would cost me another $200 to fix it.  I'm now looking for a more reliable machine.
