 If you prefer having bread that is toasted on both sides look elsewhere for a toaster. Even when it is not on the bagel "setting" it does not do any more than barely warm one side of bread.
 In addition if you are looking for a blue toaster (how I wound up with this one despite the warnings about its inefficiency) don't buy this one--it looks nothing like the picture on the internet. It is purple, so not only does it perform poorly it looks terrible in my blue/gray kitchen.
 I expected more from a KitchenAid product and if I could return a used toaster (albeit only 3 times) I certainly would.
