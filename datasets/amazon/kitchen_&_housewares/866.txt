 I loved this iron until it died after owning it for a little over a year.  I bought this iron because Consumer Reports rated it #1. It was a great iron while it worked.  (I iron about once a week - sometimes twice a month.)  I've had irons last for years and I usually get rid of them because they lack the bells and whistles not because they fail to work. Black & Decker Customer Service acted like I was the only one whoever had a problem with one of their products and told me to go buy another iron because it was over a year old.  I'm sorry, but I think with light use, an iron should last more than a year.  Forget Black & Decker. I'm trying Rowenta or Bosch
