 I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this
