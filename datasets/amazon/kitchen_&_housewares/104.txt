 I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years.  My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it.  It was making bread and just turned off.  We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem.  We now have to replace it.  It worked great until it just stopped working.  I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years.  Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house
