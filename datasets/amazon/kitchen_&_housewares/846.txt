 I wish I had read the review by Mary Twain before purchasing the Pro Form Rose Bundt.  Because it was made by Nordic Ware, I thought it would be the same as the cast aluminum but it's not.  Don't be fooled b/c the cake will not look like a rose.  The pan is more shallow & the ring is bigger than the cast aluminum.  Since I only paid $9.99 for this, I didn't want to waste paying for shipping to get a refund
