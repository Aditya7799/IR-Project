 The very first cut I made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface.  Subsequent cuts also left deep marks.  For something that's advertised as being harder than maple, I found this to be very surprising.  Maybe it's the way it's put together?  All I know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen.  Pretty much the only thing that I like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource.  Good thing because at the current rate, I anticipate needing a new one very soon
