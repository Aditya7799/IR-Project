 This one is doesn't work when it gets hot or wet (and where do you use YOUR thermometer?).
 
 Also, it is very easy to leave it "on" draining the batteries.  Replacement batteries cost nearly as much as the thermometer itself.  
 
 I have another Taylor (unfortunately, there is no model number on it).  It is auto off and saves the MAX and MIN temperatures.  The MAX is helpful when I want to check I steak on my HOT! grill.  I can hold the thermometer with a pair of thongs without burning my hands.
 
 This one is just plain useless
