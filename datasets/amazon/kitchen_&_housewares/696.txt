 We purchased this corkscrew as a gift for our daughter.  On her first attempt to use it at a holiday dinner party, we found that it required an unreasonable amount of strenghth to uncork a bottle of wine.  
 
 After contacting Amazon.com customer service, our entire $39.95 purchase price was refunded in the form of a gift certificate under their extended holiday gift return policy.
 
 Recently our daughter had an opportunity to use a corkpuller of a similar design.  It removed a cork with far less effort.
 
 In summary, we offer a rating of 5 stars for our Amazon.com buying experience and a rating of 1 star for the Metrokane Rabbit corkpuller.
