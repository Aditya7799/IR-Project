 I bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it's not built to last.  First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the "feet" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.  
 
 Cleaning is a pain, and the non-stick stuff got scraped right off. The food tray that goes on top is hard to clean too.
 
  Don't try to cook burgers in the basket, because they shrink as the fat drips out, no matter how tight you make the basket, and they start sliding around and falling apart as they hit each other. 
 
 Cooking times were always longer than the cookbook says.  
 
 I used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.
 
 I still use it, but I wouldn't buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews.  I think I'll try a George Foreman one next time
