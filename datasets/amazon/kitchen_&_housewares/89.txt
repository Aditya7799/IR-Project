 It's too bad ... I really wanted this to work, since I love soft serve. But after using it twice I donated to Goodwill.
 
 It would be great if somebody brought out a home version of the "drill" thing they use in some frozen yogurt places. Until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours, then stir it up with a spoon until it's the preferred level of softness
