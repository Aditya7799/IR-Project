 This mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air. It's horribly under powered. Seriously, it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes, and I'm talking INSTANT mashed potatoes! And mix protein drinks?? Forget about it. It leaves clumps because it doesn't spin fast enough. I'd do better twirling my finger in the glass.
 
 Consider using a spoon over using this contraption, and $20 will buy a lot of spoons. Or get a real mixer and leave it somewhere handy - same convience but it will actually work.
 
 If you don't believe me and the others here warning you, go ahead and throw your money away on it, and then you'll wind up here adding your own warning to others.
 
 Consider yourself warned
