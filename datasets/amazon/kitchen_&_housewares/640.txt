 Mine worked reasonably well for about 7 months; then stopped switching itself off and eventually overheated the plastic bulkhead which holds the coil, giving off a strong (presumably toxic) odour of melted plastic, also affecting the taste of the water. Amazon does not sell this item in Britain, where it would never get through the safety tests required by consumer legislation, but apparently they are quite happy to put American lives in danger
