 I bought a Haier RTC1700SS oven from Amazon about a month ago. I am still waiting for a replacement from Haier because the trays & spit did not fit.
 I hope by this summer I will know what it's like to cook on a con- vection oven. I'll let you know if I ever get a chance to use the one I've already paid for
