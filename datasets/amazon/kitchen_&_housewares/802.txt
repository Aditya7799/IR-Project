 If you're in the market for a used Nissan coffee mug, then step right up and order from Amazon.com!
 
 So you're probably thinking, yes, maybe I would like a used coffee mug.  How about a used coffee mug with dried, brown coffee stains still in it...And how about with the fresh aroma of a...what does that smell like, ah, Vanilla Latte I believe it is.
   
 If you're still interested, continue ordering, but be advised as customer service will be unwilling to compensate you for any issues you may have with receiving a dirty mug in the mail.  I think Nissan stainless makes a nice product, but I would
 suggest ordering from SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!  
 
 Hip, Hip, Boooooo
