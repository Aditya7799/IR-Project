 Cuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product. My criticisms of this machine: 
 1.  Its heavy and relatively large. It is awkward to place in and remove from a cabinet, and so it remains on the counter top where it takes up precious real estate with its large footprint. 
 2.  It's slow.  With its weight, you would think the grinder would have a powerful motor that would quickly grind coffee.  It does not.  It takes a very long time to grind the coffee.
 3.  The grind is uneven and actually clumps.  The grind is fine at the bottom and course and clumpy at the top.  The finely ground coffee sticks to the bottom of the bowl below the blade. I must use a finger to remove the ground  coffee or pound the bowel against the palm of my other hand. Pulsing makes no difference.  Grinding a full bowl improves the performance somewhat. Yet, grinding beans for up to minute still does not produce a grind fine enough for even a cone filter.  Espresso is out of the question.  
 4.  I invariably spill ground coffee on the counter top no matter how carefully I remove the lid.  
 Although the grinder looks cool with its stainless steel finish and it has a larger bowl than most blade grinders, those two alone do not even come close to overcoming its other deficiencies. Surely there must be better blade coffee grinders on the market
