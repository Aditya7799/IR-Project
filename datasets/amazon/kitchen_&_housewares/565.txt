 I am very disappointed with this product.  I was carving my Thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing.  The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving.  The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today.  I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth.  The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years.  The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress.
