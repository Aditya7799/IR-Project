 While it worked, it worked great.  But then it stopped working.  Only 10 months of use.  Ordered a new probe, but that didn't work.  Now, it's just an expensive timer.  Would've received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful.  Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers.  Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it's hard to go back.  The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference
