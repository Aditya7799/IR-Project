 The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag.  We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages.  The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this.  Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out.  For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.  I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.  I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality.
