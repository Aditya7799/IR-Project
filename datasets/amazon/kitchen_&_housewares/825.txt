 Assembling and disassembling this piece of equipment would discourage a person from ever using this item.  It is far too complicated and has too many pieces that have to be washed each time it is used and then put back together again.  One can expect to spend about 30 minutes to disassemble and reassemble the unit while following the assembly guide. In addition to that drawback, there isn't anything that should be placed in a dishwasher, so it has to be hand-washed and hand dried. An osterizer would be a much simpler and better choice!!!
