 Why do manufacturers always have to change a good thing?  
 
 I had a Rival crockpot for over 12 years.  It always worked great.  The idea behind a crockpot is to cood slow and low.  My old Rival cooked at 150 degrees on the "Low" setting.  
 
 I use the old Rival all the time, and decided to get a second one so I could use them both simutaneouly and cook two recipes at the same time.  I looked at the reviews for the electronic Rival models.  Everyone said they cooked too hot.  So I finally purchased this 6.5 quart model with the simple knob control.
 
 Well, I filled the crockpot full of 8 lb.s of chicken.  The next morning, I could smell the burning food.  I looked in the pot, and the chicken was boiling on the "Low" setting.  
 
 So, the next night I filled it full of a vegetable soup recipe.  The next morning, the soup was boiling over ... again on the "Low" setting.  The veggies were overcooked and mushy.  I measured the temperature and it was 195 degrees.
 
 I won't buy anymore Rival products.  I only gave this 2 stars because I guess you could conceivably use it to make soup ... If you're willing to stand over it and turn it off when it starts to overboil
