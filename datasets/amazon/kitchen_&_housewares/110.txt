 Bought one recently from a Mervyns sale.  Rice burned especially at the bottom (black & crunchy).  So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective.  Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they'll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker
