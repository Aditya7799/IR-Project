 I can't believe this is a Rowenta product! If you decide to disregard the reviews, here are some things from the owners manual (which I read before using the iron - and followed to the letter) to give you an idea how temperamental/high-maintenance this item is:
 
 *Do NOT use distilled water. You can use tap water - if it's not too hard (less than 12 grains - who actually knows this?). Softened water can also cause problems. Basically, if you use anything except bottled water, expect problems!
 
 *Empty the water from the iron after EVERY use. Failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting
 
 *Other than the Rowenta Soleplate cleaning kits (which run about $12), the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what NOT to  use.
 
 I had a very inexpensive Panasonic iron for years - given Panasonic is not really "known" for this type of item, my expectations were not high. It lasted 7 years with no problems and was low and/or no maintenance. Don't count on the Rowenta name to equate to higher quality on this one
