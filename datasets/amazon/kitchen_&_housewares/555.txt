 Granted I have never had feather pillows before so maybe this is what is to be eppected but they have no neck support whatsoever, they make disturbing crunching noises whenever I move my head and they positively REEK like a dirty henhouse. Gross! Home on the range ain't for me. I detest these, and threw them out
