 I own this pan and the Bavarian and Chrysanthemum models too.  I think Nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing.  After a few uses, everytime I bake with these pans the cake always stick.  I grease AND flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks.  One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a "non-stick" pan.  I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no "non-stick"
