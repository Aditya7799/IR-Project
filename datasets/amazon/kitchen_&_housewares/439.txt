 I received two of these baking sheets for Christmas last year; by March, 1/3 of the teflon was gone in spots.  By July, it was coming off in sheets when washed.  These Never went through the dishwasher; always hand washed.  I threw them away and purchased Baker's Secret which seems to be satisfactory so far
