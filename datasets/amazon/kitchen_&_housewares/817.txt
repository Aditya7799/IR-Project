  After getting the teakettle in January, I had to stop using it by June.  The kettle was leaking water all over the kitchen counter and at time it would not turn off by itself.  Delongi sent me a new kettle to replace the one that was broke  but it was a model only worth $80.00.  When I ask about the $50.00 difference in price of the two teakettles I was told they covered their warranty and I'm out of the $50.00. I won't be buying anymore of Delongi products!
