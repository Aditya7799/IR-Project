 I own 3 other Malibu Shores comforter sets and I just love it with no problem.  But, with this particular set I'm so disappointed with the quality of the material is poor, the areas where two materials were sewn together is tearing apart, and the stitchings are coming apart in many different parts of the comforter.  Not to mention the padding is already separating after two weeks of usage
