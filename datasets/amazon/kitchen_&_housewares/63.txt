 When our wonderful Cuisanart four-slice toaster finally died, we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk, because it seemed most similar to the old one.  What a mistake!
 
 - Even on the lowest setting, this toaster burns the crust at the bottom.
 
 - It is not easy to tell if you have it set for two slices or four. With the old toaster, it was very easy to see.
 
 - The push-down slider does not move freely and sometimes has to be pushed down two or three times before it engages.
 
 - The old toaster let you select "defrost" and "bagel" at the same time. The new toaster lets you select one or the other.
 
 All in all, a big waste of money and a major disappointment.
