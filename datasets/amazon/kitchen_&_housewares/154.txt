 I have used Pyrex bakeware for over 20 years, and I was shocked when my fairly new 9x13 pan shattered.  I figured I just got unlucky and got a bad one.  I was going to buy a new one - thank goodness I read the reviews first!  And yes, I did follow instructions - I baked my lasagne at 350 degrees, did not use an open flame or broiler, etc etc.  I can't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold!  I am so mad!  I am switching to Corningware now
