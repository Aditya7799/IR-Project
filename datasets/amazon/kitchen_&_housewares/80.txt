 I use a blender to do two things: 1) make smoothies; and 2) stir batter for crepes.  
 
 This device apprently cannot handle frozen fruit.  The white, plastic "teeth" on the bottom of the blades, that mesh / connect to the motor's "teeth," immediately started breaking.  Three smoothies later only one plastic tooth remains and it is starting to fracture.  (My smoothies were made of yogurt, O.J., some frozen mango... nothing extreme.)
 
 As far as the crepes go, even with only one "tooth" remaining, this baby still can stir eggs, milk, and a little flour (thank you for small miracles).  But... the glass jug is a dribbler.  When you pour batter or smoothies or whatever, some of the liquid will always (I mean always) dribble off the glass jug's lip, down the front of the jug, down the front of the control panel, and also into the recessed area where those "teeth" meet each other.  So... you have to clean ALL the blender each time you use it (i.e., the jug, the control panel, the recessed area in which the jug sets) not just clean the jug. What a pain in the neck.
 
 Once the last tooth breaks, this baby is going in the garbage.
