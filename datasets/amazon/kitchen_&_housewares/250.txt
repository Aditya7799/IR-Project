 I have a Profesional 6 model, and I did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta.  It didn't kill the mixer, but the motor became very hot!  I will never use it again.  I also have the roto slicer/shredder, fruit/veggie strainer, food grinder & sausage stuffer attachments...none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm.  --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product.  I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!
 
 My best advice is to pick up an inexpensive pasta machine or an Emperia hand crank pasta machine. They run between $20-40 without a motor or $80-120 with a motor (that you can also buy separately for $50-80). --A very small price to pay, if you want to keep your KitchenAid Stand Mixer!
