 The first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer
