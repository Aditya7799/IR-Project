 The description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs. I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine.
