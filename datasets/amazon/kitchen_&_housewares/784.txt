 I have owned this breadman for one year.  I make between one and two loafs of bread per week.  Mostly whole wheat bread.  I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).
 Pros:
 It makes a good loaf of bread.
 Good selection of cycles.
 Loaf is easy to extract from the pan.
 
 Cons:
 The motor is not very powerful.  It lugs down when making whole wheat bread.
 After 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle.
 At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.
 
 Overall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it
