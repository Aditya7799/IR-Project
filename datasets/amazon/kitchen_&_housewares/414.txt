 I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least;  it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product.  It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets
