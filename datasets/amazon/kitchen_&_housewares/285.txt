 I myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months.
 So after reading the other reviews, I'm no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine...and it won't be a Delonghi
