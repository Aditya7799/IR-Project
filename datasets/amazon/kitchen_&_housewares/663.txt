 Although I ONLY hand washed these pots and pans, somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd year, the nonstick coating on the pans started lifting.  I also do not use metal cooking utensils.  
 
 All that being said, I still use these pots and pans (been almost 5 years now).
 
 Overall, I originally bought this set for ~$300 5 years ago.  The pots are still in excellent condition. If I was looking for pots and pans, I would consider purchasing another set at $150.  
 
 I do cook a lot (used for business) so my 5 years with these pans may equate to 7-10 years of normal use
