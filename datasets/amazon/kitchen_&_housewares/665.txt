 I ordered 2 sets of four in case there was any breakage...and guess what...1 ramekin was broken leaving me with 7 dishes.  To top it off, a few days later, I found a comparable set, slightly larger, at Big Lots, for only $7 for four.  Of course this is always the risk we take through mail order...often it is not worth the time or trouble to get refunds or replacements
