 Although I ordered the juicer in the color black, I received the product in white.  If not for the color I would have purchased it locally.  After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional.  Some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off.  I had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years.  I am obviously totally disappointed
