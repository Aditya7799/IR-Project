 After checking every store I could think of and accepting that I'd have to go online, I laughed out-loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don't even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. "Train Man." The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it's not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing.
