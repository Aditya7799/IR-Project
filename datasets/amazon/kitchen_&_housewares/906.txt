 We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust. 
 
 PROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware.
 CONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year
