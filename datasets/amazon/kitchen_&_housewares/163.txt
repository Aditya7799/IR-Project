 We have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it.  We now have to borrow a friends Hoover Steamvac when we need to clean the carpet.  We are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right.  It never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection.  I wouldn't buy
