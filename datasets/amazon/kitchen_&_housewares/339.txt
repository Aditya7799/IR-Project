 I bought this on 8/4/06.  When I first got the coffee maker, I ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out.  Afterwards, the machine still smelled like plastic, now I've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help.  The horrible plastic smell is still there.  Baking soda is no use also.  The only thing I've not used is bleach.  If you don't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups.  Makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems
