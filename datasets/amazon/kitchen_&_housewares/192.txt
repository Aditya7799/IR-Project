 The frother is great!  Easy to use etc.  The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes.  At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso.  Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate.  This occurs when the grind is too fine.  I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine.  To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap.  I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.  Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also.  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother.
