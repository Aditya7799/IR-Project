 These were sent instead of the black-handled set I ordered so I thought I would give them a try. They are listed as "dishwasher safe", but evidently are not. Brown stains (rust?) appeared on the tops of all the handles. I cleaned them with silver polish, but the stains reappeared with subsequent washings. I have returned them and received a refund
