 I should have simply repaired our old toaster that worked well, and reliably, for eight years.  Too busy, first I bought a Braun toaster (looked great, had major problems actually toasting), then I bought this Krup toaster, and guess what, it looks great but has trouble actually toasting.  Starting with the first piece of toast all is well (hence two stars instead of one).  However, after the toaster is warmed up, the timing/heat regulation becomes totally useless.  You have to toast, toast again, toast again.  Fancy digital count-down-timer doesn't help much at that point!  In researching toasters, did I mention I should have repaired my old toaster when it broke, I read a review where it was suggested that 'toasters have been around a hundred years, it can't be that hard!'  I thought it funny at the time, but having now spent over $150 on two worthless toasters I find myself saying "toasters have been around for over a 100 years, it can't be that hard!"  I hope Braun and/or Krup don't make medical devices or we are in trouble.
