 If the probe was not so fragile I'd give this unit 5 stars. The remote works well although I have had it lose contact with the sender if I was out in front of my house (my grill is on the back deck). This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating "HIGH" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn't have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail. But within a few weeks several of those failed. I don't mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying. I'd suggest staying away from this unit
