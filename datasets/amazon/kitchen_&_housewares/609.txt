 This was supposed to be the toaster to end all toasters. 
 We had it for about 2.5 years, and now the toast brown on only one side. The outer heating elements still work. The inner elements work at about 1/3 capacity of the outer ones. We now turn our toast around after a couple minutes to cook the other side. Until we find the next toaster to end all toasters. This one was not it!
