 I purchesed this product not too long ago and whoever disigned it should take a look at the silverware basket.  They sould come up with a better way to drain the silverware because the silverware basket hangs over the counter in every position I tried.  Needless to say, I took it back because the basket would have drained my silverware all over my counter and not in the drain board. I think its a nice dish rack but the basket has to be redisigned to drain in the drain board and not over the counter. Looks are very decieving, in the picture it looks like the basket is over the drain board but its not.  I hope this helps others before they decide to buy this product
