 A friend bought a food saver by Tilia and told me that it would be wonderful for storing my bulk shopping in the freezer.  I saved for it and got it.  I used it a total of 10 times and not for long periods of time and it literally died.  I sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return - they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell.  Just be careful and do not let this happen to you - Tilia looks much better on TV than it performs in real life.
