 I bought this rack thinking that I can now bake cakes with bigger size, or cool a bunch of cookies on the same rack; well...I am very disappointed. But let's start witht he good things first.
 
 PROS:
 1. It's big, I like the size a lot
 2. It's gridded, so I don't need to worry about cookies falling off the rack. They are steady right there.
 
 CONS: 
 The biggest problem is the material, it is not strong at all!
 
 When the rack arrived, the middle of it was already bent (or sagging a bit). I was able to bent it backwards easily, yet that "perfect" posture didn't hold for long, it's back to its bad sagging position again very soon.
 
 Then it got way worse, when I try to cool cakes on it. Cookies aren't that bad, since they are light. When I have the moist and right out of the oven cake sitting on that rack, the middle of the rack is barely touching my kitchen counter top already. Of course, as soon as I lift my cake up, it goes back to the normal sagging position.
 
 I think unless you are planning on baking cookies only...this is not a rack for you. Pick something else, something stronger
