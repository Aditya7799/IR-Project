 This toaster at the lowest setting of 1 burns my toast.  It also burned one side of a frozen bagel when I put it on defrost.
 
 Further, when plugged in, the dial is lit up by a red light.  It makes me feel like the toaster is on, and needs to be turned off.  I have to keep reminding myself that it is okay.  If I can find the box, I'll probably return it.  Maybe I just got a dud, since most reviews here are goo
