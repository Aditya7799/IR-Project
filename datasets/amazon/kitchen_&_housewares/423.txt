 When it worked it worked well.  However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken.  I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up.  I can see a line here and there, but nothing else.  Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information.  It is defintely NOT worth $30
