 I should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer.  Now I wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten one from Jiffy.
 
 The box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped.  It definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer, and lucky me, I got sloppy seconds.
 
 I read the instructions and assembled it carefully, but the performance is just awful.  Even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds, as the instructions indicate, it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam.  Additionally, it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes, and I don't mean a few spots of water like you get with any  steamer
