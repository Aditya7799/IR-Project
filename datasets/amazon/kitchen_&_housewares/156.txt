 I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex.  Until now.  Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded.  It rained glass all over the inside of my oven.  It was a disaster.  I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time.  This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM!
