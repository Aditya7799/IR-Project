 I bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times.  The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush).  
 
 The tea infuser is not very effective though.  The holes are a bit on the large side, so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through.  And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn't extend deep enough).  So I don't use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour).
 
 However, my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour.  So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter.  I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session).  I found that pretty annoying.
 
 So in conclusion, for the price I paid for this teapot's supposedly wonderful features, I don't think it was a good buy.
