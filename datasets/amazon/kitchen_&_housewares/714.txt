 I purchased this item from a well known home shopping TV show.  After 4 months, it's no longer working.  Also, it is advertised as being able to be put into the diswasher.  I have an average size diswasher and it DOES NOT FIT!!  I have contacted the manufacturer and will return it for repair or replacement! 
 
 Note, when it worked it was great!  I mainly purchased it for the reversable grill
