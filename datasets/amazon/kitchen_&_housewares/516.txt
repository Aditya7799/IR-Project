 I purchased this about 1 year ago and it's only taking up space in my house.  It has very poor suction on carpeting.  Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will.  I expected better force.  The small openning may look "cool" but it doesn't allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again.  Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in.  I would consider look at others first
