 Let me begin with a positive note on the OXO Good Grips oven mitt:  It looks great and the magnet is a good idea. Now for the negative aspects of this item:  it's WAY over-priced, especially for how poorly it is designed. The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a "Good Grip," which is ironic since it's called the "OXO Good Grips" oven mitt.  It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures.  I strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this OXO mitt, you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design.
