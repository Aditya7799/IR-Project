 I am on my third machine now, and it too is leaking.  Dont get me wrong, the coffee tastes really good, always fresh.  But after a while the machine starts to leak when you are making a cup of coffee.  I guess the machine only cost 25 bucks now, so if you dont mind only using it for a month it is a great buy
