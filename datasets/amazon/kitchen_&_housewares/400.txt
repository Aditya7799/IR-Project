 We also bought the FCP12 after years of hearing from satisfied Farberware users. Unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm, tea - like coffee. I removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so. After a few times of this monkey business, I contacted Farberware and was told I had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base. The best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price. Shipping would be on me both directions as well, I told them I would not pay any price for another one of their products, based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it. I am going to try replacing the thermostat, as I like perked coffee, but I am not convinced it will last any longer, time will tell
