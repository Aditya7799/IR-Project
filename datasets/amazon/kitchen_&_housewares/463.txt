 I just received this knife yesterday &amp; am sending it back for a refund.  Upon first use, the forked metal tip broke off when I was chopping tomatoes for a salad.  It took me a few moments to notice the lost tip (as it had ended up in the salad I was preparing.)  Could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip!  The knife itself is flimsy, can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well
