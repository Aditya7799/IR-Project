 I liked the look of these pots. I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta, potatoes etc. The stainless steel used is very poor quality.
 
 After just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot. After the first use I noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms, not your typical discoloration from heat, and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend. These spots are now where I see rust forming after each use. These are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware, but then again neither is the price.
 
 All said I wouldn't buy them again. Even cheap stainless steel pots and pans shouldn't rust with normal use. Even the free Cuisinart Santoku Knife I received is rusting and I've only used it 3 times. I cannot stress how bad the steel is!
 
 As far as cooking goes, they work great. The aluminum core bottoms conduct the heat well. They also have a great look aside from the rusting
