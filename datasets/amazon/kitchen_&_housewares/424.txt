 I bought this air cleaner in March of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in January 04.  There was no indication that anything was amiss, I was changing the pre-filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing; no lights, no sound, no activity.  Am sending it back to Honeywell (on my nickel according to their warranty policy).  We will see how long the replacement lasts.  I have read several reviews here that don't give me much hope.  Amazon was nice, said I needed to contact Honeywell directly but suggested I post a review
