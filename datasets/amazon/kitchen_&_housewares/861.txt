 I spent several hours searching &amp; researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice &quot;measurements&quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the &quot;keep warm&quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet &amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice
