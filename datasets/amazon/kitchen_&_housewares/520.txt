 I bought this cookie press to make my favorite Christmas cookies-Spritz.  I got the dough into the gun, squeezed the handle, kept squeezing the handle, and nothing.  The mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping, and hence, no cookies.  It was very frustrating, having everything ready to make the cookies, but with no way to properly form them.  I would not recommend this cookie press
