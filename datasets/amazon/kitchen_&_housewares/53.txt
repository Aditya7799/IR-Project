 The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing.  This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people).  At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink.  I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer.  Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper.  Also the blade takes a while to clean
