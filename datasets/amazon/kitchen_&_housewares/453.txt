 I liked the mug's look, feel, & size. Then I took a drink of java from this mug... I never could get a lip lock on this mug. The rim is very thin & very wide. It would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt. Nissan mugs have what I call a "lip ledge" that prevents the "dribble" effect to which the Bodum is prone. Nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts
