 Thought for years, I was missing something by not having a Cuisinart!  What a laugh.  In the few months I have had this unit, two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken.  I did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using.  This is an obvious design defect.  Guess I was lucky, in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything.  Now they want the broken item returned, which is an inconvenience and a delay.  I was without my replacement last time, at least six weeks.  I plan to return this item and purchase a different brand
