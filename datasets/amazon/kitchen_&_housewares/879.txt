 I bought the VillaWare Double Smoothee maker and it was a problem from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  First, the silver lable was not glued on the product and wouldn't stick.  Next when I made the product using THEIR receipe it wouldn't dispense from the spout and the spout connecting to the blender leaked.  Tried calling the seller and emailing them about my problem and they wouldn't help.  I called the manufacture and since I bought it HERE from a vendor they would help.  So...now...its in the blender heaven of trash somewhere out there.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  THANK GOD FOR AMAZON'S ABC GUARANTEE!!
