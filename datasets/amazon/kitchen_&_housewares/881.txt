 When I opened the box, I noticed corrosion on the lid.  When I contacted Rival customer service via email, they told me I had to purchase a new lid.  I called and spoke with a customer service representative and they told me that a lid was not covered under warranty.  When I explained that I just opened it and it was defective they told me to just return the product that there was nothing that they were going to do.  
 
 After being treated this way, I will NOT be purchasing any more Rival products if they don't stand behind their product!!!!!  VERY VERY poor customer service
