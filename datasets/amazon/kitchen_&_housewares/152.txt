 This sushi set is really nice. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't know how to ship ceramic properly.
 
 In my original order, they sent it in a medium-sized box, with air cushions only on one side. Of course several of the pieces were shattered. So I requested a replacement via the returns website. 
 
 The second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day. That was impressive. What was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Naturally this set was also shattered.
 
 Fortunately, I hadn't yet returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second. I'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that, but as I see it I've saved them the cost of a refund.
 
 Needless to say I won't be ordering ceramic flatware from Amazon again.
 
 Once again, I like the style of the set itself, and think it's a great deal for the price. I just recommend that you buy it somewhere else.
