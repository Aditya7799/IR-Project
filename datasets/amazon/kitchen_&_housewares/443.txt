 I bought these plates after I already had the rest of the matching dishes. I already knew that I was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last. 
 They are really sturdy and go with everything BUT they get the 'knife-marks' - grey scratch marks from utensils scraping them. I imagine that there are white dishes out there somewhere that are not subject to this flaw, and if there are I hope to find them, but these are not them
