 I loved this coffeemaker, until it just suddenly stopped working and it isn't even 1 year old!!  Previous coffeemakers I owned have lasted years and years.   I expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over $[...]+.  Now I have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle.  I am NOT a happy customer
