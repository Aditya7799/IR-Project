 Have been wanting to get the pasta roller attachment and ran accross this plastic pasta maker at the store.  Was really excited since it was in my price range.  Took it home and tried to use it.  My KitchenAid mixer starting smoking and so I let it rest for the hour.  Upon removing the attachment I found oil and black rubber or grease was all over the inside of the attachment. (on the coil thing that pushes the dough through) Next time I wanted to use my mixer to beat egg whites it had no power.  I sure hope this inexpensive attachment didn't ruin my wonderful mixer.  Highly disappointed with KitchenAid on this attachment
