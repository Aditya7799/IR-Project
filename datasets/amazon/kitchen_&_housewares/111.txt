 I bought this in October, 2004 because I wanted something small for my kitchen.  You cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker.  Now, it shuts off mid-way and I have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it.  Hopefully the "powers that be" will read these comments and make improvements
