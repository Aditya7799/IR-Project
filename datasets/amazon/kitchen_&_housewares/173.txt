 The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound.   This new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room.  Save your money and buy something cheaper.  It will work as well if not better.  I returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too.
