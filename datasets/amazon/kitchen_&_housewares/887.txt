 I purchased these pans based on my previous positive experiences with Calphalon cookware--have tons of it, but I experienced the same problem as two other reviewers--that is, the slumping in the middle.  I have been cooking for over 30 years and have never experienced this problem, especially since I have a new Kitchen-Aid convection oven.  Also, the &quot;non-stick&quot; is not so &quot;non-stick&quot;.   At their prices, I think they have a little work to do to meet other Calphalon products
