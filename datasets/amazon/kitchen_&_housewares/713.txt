 After using this product twice I was extremly disapointed.
 The drip tray does not catch all the dripping from frying bacon.
 The grease ends up all over the counter and melting the base unit that the drip tray fits in.  You would think Wolfgang Puck would try this product under all conditions to make sure it is enginered corectly.  My counters are level so this is not an issue.  I am a dissatisfied customer.
