 Bought it two months ago, used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week. Called manufacturer, got return label, sent in for replacement, but three weeks passed and I still have not received anything. So I called them on Nov 17, 2006, and was told they don't have this model in stock. The worst part is that they also said they do not know when it will be ever in stock, maybe tomorrow or may in a year.
 
 I wish I had tried to return it to Amazon rather than called manufacture for return/replacement.
 
 Do not buy this model!!! and maybe we should not buy any Breadman branded products at all since the customer service from manufacturer is astonishingly bad.
