 I wish it was possible to give less than 1 star!  Went through dishwasher once, came out rust!  Save your money....or your packaging!  I thought Chicago cutlery; how can I go wrong?  so out the packaging went!  I called Chicago Cutlery.  Turns out some of their stuff is now made in China. Wouldn't that make it China Cutlery?
