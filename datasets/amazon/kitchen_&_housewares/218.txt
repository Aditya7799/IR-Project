 I have not tried this pasta attachment a second time - I'm afraid of harming the motor.  The mixer became VERY hot and oil even leaked out.  I going to get the mixer checked/serviced and not risk damage again. One thing missing from these reviews is the mixer models used. Perhaps those with the heavier motors work better?  I have the smaller motor (250 W) K45SS mixer.  Surely KitcheAid must read these reviews. I would expect some additional user information for this product on their website, but see nothing. Very disappointing product and consumer support.  Come on KitchenAid - give more info and/or offer to give $$ credit for return of this questionable product
