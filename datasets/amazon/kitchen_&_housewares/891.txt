 I have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders.  I have always loved  Cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one, what a mistake!  The grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it's size. The coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top, making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee.  
 DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!
