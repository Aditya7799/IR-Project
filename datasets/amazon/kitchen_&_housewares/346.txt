 I agree with other writers.  This unit is very poorly designed and built.  Cutting my third loaf of bread, the knife point came out of the guide, and on return, snaped one of the guides off.  Not washable, end plate falls off while cutting all the time, unit slides over the counter when trying to cut (rubber feet would have cured this).  I would look elsewhere before buying this unit
