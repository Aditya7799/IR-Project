 I have tried to purchase this item since May 2006. Without explanation, after my order was processed and I was given a date of delivery the order was cancelled and I received a notice that the  board was not available.
 How strange is that? 
 If you call the company they tell you the item is availble through Amazon.
 Would really like to understand what has happened.
 I feel somewhat less unhappy since I read a review of this very pricey item saying it was not worth the cost.
