 I really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box.  It's looks well made and looked easy to use.  I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer.  I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes.  When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad.  I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say
