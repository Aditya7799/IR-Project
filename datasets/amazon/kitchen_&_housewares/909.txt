 Look, the product plainly reads "Oster Blender Blade with Gasket" and the package that was delivered is titled "Processing Unit with Sealing Ring".  The blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring/gasket to be found.  I'm sure there is the possibility that I got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that?!  I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem.  I now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1.50 and will pay shipping of probably $3.
