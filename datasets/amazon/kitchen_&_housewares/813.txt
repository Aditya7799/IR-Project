 I bought this product because the box says "no more ice chunks." There is even an "icebreaker" setting.  I wanted a way to make slushies.  However, the manual says you are to use the "icy drink" setting when crushing ice.  I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the "icebreaker" setting!
   Also, the whole ice crushing process requires many steps and more than a blender.  First, you have to pour water in before you can crush the ice.  Once you press the "icy drink" setting, you pour out the excess water into a collander.
   Even after all that, there are chunks in the ice. No slushie for me!
   I gave this product just 1 star because I hate misleading advertising.  I will now have to take time out of my crammed schedule to return this product
