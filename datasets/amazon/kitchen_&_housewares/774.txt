 True, these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash, however, that isn't my concern.......
 
 The description states that these sheets will fit a mattress up to 14 inches thick.  My pillowtop mattress is about 11 inches thick and these sheets don't fit!  I washed them in cold water and used the lowest dryer setting.  What a pain
