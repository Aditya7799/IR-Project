 This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It's only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it's on fire, and I believe that it's the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me "too bad". And it's not like it's an inexpensive vacuum at $289! 
 
 I will never again buy a Hoover product
