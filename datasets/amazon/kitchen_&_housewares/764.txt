 When I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited.  I couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts.  And as expected the results were great.     Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves.  Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped.  At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse.     I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade.  Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don't feel these pans will last.     I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon.  And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans
