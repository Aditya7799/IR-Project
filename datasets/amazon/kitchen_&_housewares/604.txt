 I got one with my foodsaver.    I like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a couple of uses.   Also the manufacture is not handy friendly.   I was injured and can't speak.    When I tried to get help  by email they told me I needed to get friend or family member to call them if I wanted help.   That just wrong.   I guess they haven't heard about the equal access laws
