 I am an avid cook and baker.  I used this unit twice and it broke after the 2nd useage. I found it to be very slow; the charge didn't last long so I had to keep it plugged in.  The dough had to be very very soft in order for the press to produce the cookies.  I am very disappointed that such an expensive item would operate so poorly
