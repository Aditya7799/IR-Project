 This is a cheap piece of junk.  The base won't communicate with the remote even after extensive review of directions and trying different channel selections as directed.  The plastic housings are so lightweight I don't think it'd survive ordinary outdoor use either.  Certianly not a drop off your grill.  Felt like I had to handle it gingerly so I didn't crush it with my hands.  This one is going back -Sorry AZ.
