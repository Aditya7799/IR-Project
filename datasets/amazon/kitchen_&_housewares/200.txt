 I ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times.  They kept sending the "Commercial 5 mixer."  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  "cookie" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.  But no mixer!
 
 Calls end up in whatever country.  All they do is placate you with polite rhetoric and pat answers.  Which is their job.  But this does not address the major problem.  The problem is never kicked up to a higher level, researched, investigated and thus ending in a resolution.
 
 Now I see this model or its equivalent, in Costo.  Very cheap but with the steel attachments (whip, dough hook etc) like the Commerical one.  It looks like a combination of the Pro 5 Plus and the Commercial one.  And the model no. is not listed in KitchenAde's website.  There seems to be something amiss with this Pro 5 Plus model. 
 
 This has been a frustrating experience.  I now plan to order the Pro 6 instead, which Cook's Illustrated listed as number one.  And it won't be from Amazon.  Receiving the wrong one three times is a bit much.  Dissapointed in the service.
