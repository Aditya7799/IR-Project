 This product is sick! If you get a "delight" out of seeing an fish hung  like a Christmas decoration in a ball that is way too small too  live in your sick! Plus a nightlight? Try sleeping w/ no eyelids w/ a light over your head. Fish sleep too, but  they cant close their eyes. There does not even seem to be much air space above the water. It's the same problem with those silly bowls with the plants on top. They breath oxygen and sufficate witout fresh air. Get at least a five gal. tank and don't waste your $ on this cheap fad product. Bettas are so smart, fun and sociable and desarve just as much respect as all of our fellow pets and humans
