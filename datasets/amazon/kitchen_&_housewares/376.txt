 For years I used my mother's cookie shooter to make my holiday spritz cookies.  When I bought my first house I wanted my own cookie shooter.  Boy, I wish I hadn't purchased this one.  
 
 The first time I used it I thought, "It shouldn't be this hard to use or take this long!" But I was using it correctly.  The motor is SO WEAK!  My biggest grip however is with the threaded rod that twists to push the dough out.  The rod has an indentation all the way down, so when it's twisting, it constantly skips back up and never eventually pushes the dough down the tube.  If I do get a cookie out of it, it's misshaped and took at least 30 seconds to get out.
 
 What a piece of junk!
