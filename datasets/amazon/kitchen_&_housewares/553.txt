 I have had the Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffeemaker for about six months or so and loved it.  This morning, however, it decided to stop working correctly.   I left the kitchen while it was brewing and all of the coffee leaked all over the counter.  What a mess!  I then made just 2 cups and put a coffee cup under the spout and watched it.  Sure enough as the coffee was brewing the spout was spewing.  I don't know what coffeemaker to buy now
