 I have numerous Le Creuset items, and this has to be the worst one.  Everything sticks to the finish.  Salsbury steak turns out horrible (can't make gravy), breakfast sausage patties become ground sausage pieces due to the sticking.  And, like mentioned in an earlier post, it is hard to clean.  Beware this new finish, (they have it on their grill pans also)it is not up to par
