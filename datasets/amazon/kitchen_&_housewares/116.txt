 I am a major fan of "Le Creuset" pots and have a number of them but I must say that their kettle is not up to par.
 
 Like the other lady said, it does spit out water (substantially at that) when it boils on the stove.  I am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since I have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and I have been boiling "contaminated" water since a while...I just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water....I wonder what kind of chemicals I have been putting in my body???
