 This product simply does not work.  The vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine, even for a day.  I have used a Vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost.  We bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the Vacuvin -- and it is.  The reason:  it doesn't preserve the wine.  I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane
