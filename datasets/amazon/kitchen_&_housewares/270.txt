 The machine leaked after we poured in the liquid ingredients.The mix in dispenser did not operate properly, all we put in were sprinkles. The ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes;kids cannot wait that long.We could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time. Save your money,buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time
