 After your pan starts sticking, you go to their web site to complain and you find .... A warning that you can't use high heat on this pan.  They warn you if you use high heat or some sprays, the pan will then start to stick.  Yes, you've just been ..... and you paid $40 for the privilege.  Imagine, a frying pan that doesn't like heat.  How much heat?  They don't tell you.  If your pan is sticking, then it must have been toooo much.  Buy at your own risk
