 I've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.
 
 One solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement.
