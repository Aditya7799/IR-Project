 I received the gelato maker in the mail and was eady to try it out.  Got all the ingredients together and in the bowl and loaded it into the machine.  I turned on the machine as per the directions and it beeped and flashed at my just like it is supposed to do when it has been on too long and the machine is freezing up.  I was not very happy with this predicament at all
