 I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  
 
 I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.
 
 But, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.
 
 I did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.
 
 From a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it's beautiful but it's not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were
