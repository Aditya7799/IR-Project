 I can't believe someone uses this pan to cook eggs! I have tried several cooking oils and butter, and everything sticks to this pan, making it very difficult to clean. My husband won't even use it. 
 
 I have reverted to my tried and true cast iron pan that never lets me down. Even the cheapo stainless pans I got at Ross are better than this. 
 
 TERRIBLE
