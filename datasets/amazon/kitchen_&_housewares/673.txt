 The decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish.  I was thrilled. I have been looking all over to find one that size in glass.  I was so mad and disappointed when I opened the box and it was 8.5 x 4.5.  That wasn't what I ordered.  And yes when baking bread there is a difference.  I am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so I can ship this back. This would have been a great deal, except I already have the 8.5 x 4.5 pans.  They need to change the dimensions in the description.  Buyer beware!
