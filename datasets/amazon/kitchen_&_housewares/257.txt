 Bought this for the kitchen and the only piece that truly does what it is supposed to do is the vase they give to hold all the pieces.  The spoons both melted in pots of boiling water stirring spaghetti.  The spatula bent and distorted while trying to lift something off a hot cookie sheet.
 
 If there was a choice to give a half star, that is all I would give.....you have to give them some credit, since the vase looks nice on the counter &lt;Grin
