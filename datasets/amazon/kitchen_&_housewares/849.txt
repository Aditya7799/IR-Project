 To start with, the one-star rating is actually for the customer service department.  When it works, the product itself is fine.  
 
 I bought the unit last Christmas and used it frequently until early summer.  At that time it began functioning only intermittently, then soon quit altogether.  Tilia assurred me that it was covered under a one-year warranty, that it would be replaced, and that I needn't return the original unit.  Our next call was prompted by its failure to arrive in a reasonable time.  We were told that they had no replacements, it was back-ordered, and would arrive within several weeks.  When it didn't, I called again and was told that the replacements had arrived and would be shipping soon.  Our next call yielded the information that the replacements had NOT arrived afterall and that Tilia had no idea when they would.  The saga continues...
