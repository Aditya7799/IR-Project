 My spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel-cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues.  Like the Black & Decker 15.6V CHV1560 cordless hand vacuum, the battery life is 4 months tops.
 
 Perhaps Black & Decker should replace the nickel-cadium battery with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery on all of their cordless hand vacuums
