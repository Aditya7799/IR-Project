 My wife and I purchased the 40616 Hamilton Beach Perculator at K-Mart. After only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot--only luke warm.K-Mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days. This should give you an idea of what K-Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator.When I  called Hamilton Beach customer no-service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment. The $9.95
 is 25% of the original price of the perculator so I will decline their offer. If their perculator only last for 8 months I don't even want to pay the $9.95 to get a new one. I feel that it should have been replaced for free! In their warranty booklet they tell you that the 40616 perculator has a limited 2-year warranty but that is only if you are willing to pay $9.95 to ship their defective equipment back to them. Because of this experience with the Hamilton Beach 40616 coffee perculator I will never purchase any Hamilton Beach equipment in the future.I will also not purchase anything else from K-Mart
