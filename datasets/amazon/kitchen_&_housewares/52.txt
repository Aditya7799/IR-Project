 This grill is better in theory than practice.  I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones.  It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches.  I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else.  It is easy to clean, so that's a plus
