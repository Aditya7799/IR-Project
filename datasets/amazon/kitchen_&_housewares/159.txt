 I owned a Rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it.  When it stopped working I therefore bought another (this one) from Rival.  I've used it twice.  The top doesn't seem to keep the liquid in, even on low, and it burned the food both times.  I don't trust it now and am not sure whether I'll try it again.
