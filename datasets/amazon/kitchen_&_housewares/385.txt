 This product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all very
 good. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have to
 bend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumps
 into the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in the
 litter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not really
 something I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps going
 into the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.
 Also, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almost
 right in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was very
 small. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad to
 have the old fashioned scoop litter box
