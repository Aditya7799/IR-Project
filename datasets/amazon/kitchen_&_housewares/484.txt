 A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit.  You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.
 
 If it wasn't for the fact that we spent nearly $100 for this unit, I would throw it away.
