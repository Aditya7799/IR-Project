 I purchased a 14-cup Cuisinart some years ago.  I have had nothing but trouble.  First the handle stuck while I was kneading dough and I barely was able to pry it off.  Then I had problems with the stem.  When I tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested I buy a new Cuisinart!  Stay away from Cuisinart!  I'm looking into Kitchen Aid for my new processor
