 This was an excellent item...for about 3 uses...then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness...it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth.   MIU France says this is not their problem..."just buy a new one".  With an attitude like that...and product failure so quickly.....yes, I will buy a different brand...and avoid MIU France product
