 I should have listened to the other reviews!
  
 Point 1. This machine is not only just "noisy", it CONTINUES to be loud, intermittently! Picture this: You are sipping your hot drink while reading the newspaper, relaxed, the house quiet, when like a knife cutting the silence, a loud grinding sound flies from the kitchen, your dog starts howling & barking, you jump and relaxation is out the window! It "recycles" as long as you leave it on.
 
 Point 2. It took me TWO cycles (20 minutes) before the stuff was hot enough for me. I like beverages to be as hot as coffee.
 
 Point 3. Take out your best scrubber & roll up your sleeves!! For every use, you have to scrub the thick coating off the bottom of the non-immersable pitcher PLUS totally take apart the spout, clean it & put it back together (it has 5 parts). Hope you have time for this!
 
 Point 4. Froth? What froth? That's froth?? Stirring my drink with a spoon makes it look like that.
 
 
 Final analysis: I can make the same thing in the microwave with less cleanup
