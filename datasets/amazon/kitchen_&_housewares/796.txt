 I had this machine for about 3 years with no issues. But, how often do most people use their machine?  I used it maybe 15 to 20 times.  I went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden I see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell (We all know what that smell means) The plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita's were everywhere (except in my glass).  We had to throw the whole machine out.  Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can't find one thats non plastic I will use my blender.  The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again.  (I believe this one was a gift to me)  Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists, obviously the motor doesn't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I've read.
