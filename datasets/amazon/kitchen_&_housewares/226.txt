 When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray! It worked so well for my four cats that a few months later, I bought a second one. Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.
 
 After researching better and more reliable options, I've settled on the Omega Paw box that you roll to clean. I now have three of them -- no electric parts to break, and, actually, less mess than the LitterMaid
