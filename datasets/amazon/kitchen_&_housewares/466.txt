 I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it
