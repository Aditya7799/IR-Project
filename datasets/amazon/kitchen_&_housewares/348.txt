 The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan
