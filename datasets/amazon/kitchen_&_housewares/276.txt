 I've had this toaster for four years now. It just started going down hill recently. 
 -It started toasting too darkly on the settings I had consistently used for years. 
 -The digital setting knob no longer works, it is stuck on 4. 
 -It only shuts off when manually popped up. 
 I have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even. I've noticed this in my four years of use. 
 So if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it. If not, try another with better reviews
