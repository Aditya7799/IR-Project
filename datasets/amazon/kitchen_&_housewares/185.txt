 My Screwpull Lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1+year.  Locked up and when I pulled a little harder it stripped a gear (the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic.)  
 
 I suspect the lockup during the twist-cork-in -then-lift-up cycle was due to worn part within the screw housing.
 
 In any event, it's unacceptable for something this expensive to fail with
 such limited use.  At the very least, the gear mechanism should be stainless steel vice metal-plastic to provide better wear.
 
 Plus, we just talking about a stupid corkscrew.  How hard /costly would it be to build something decent vice a piece of overpriced yuppy crap??
