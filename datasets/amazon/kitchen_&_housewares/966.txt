 I bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter. As soon as I saw the pan I was a little disappointed with the ridges. They are deep (which is good) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos. So your meats will be less brown.
 
 After rubbing it with a litlle oil before cooking I set out to make my first set of turkey burgers. Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions, garlic, and green chillies to the ground meat. That is where the pan gave problems. The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions, garlic, and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean. I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time.
 
 For cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok. For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries. I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself.
 
 Update (12/18/2004) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $20 which is tremendous. It is non-stick, dish-washer compatible and cooks great.
