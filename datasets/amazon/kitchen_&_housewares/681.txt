 Very, very, disappointed and irritated.  HUMBUG,   I ordered this rice cooker and I just received it today.  I really wish, I had read some of the reviews above.  The description on this site clearly states that the rice cooker stays warm for 5 hours!
 
    The manual clearly states it does NOT.  I bought it because of the keep warm for 5 hours promise.  I can get a CHEAP, basic  cook and shut off  at Wal-Mart for  $12  here in Georgia. 
 
  I'll be sending it back tomorrow, and I'm very upset that I have to take the time to do it,   HUMBUG!~  I like Amazon .com, but I'm really mad about this.  No Christmas rice for me
