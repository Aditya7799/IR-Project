 I am really dissapointed with this bread machine!
 I had a panasonic 1 lb. breadmaker which I loved--but wanted a machine with a bigger loaf capacity. Never had any problems with the smaller panasonic, and received the Oster 5838 fo Christmas and have had nothing but bad experience--how many times do you have to experiment with the thing to get a good loaf of bread--like the Panasonic, you should be able to follow the instructiona and get a good loaf of bread!!
 We also gave 2 of these for gifts --and really feel bad as they are a pain--all 3 are going back!
