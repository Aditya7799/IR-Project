 I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive.  I placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use, and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done.  I then checked Amazon's reviews, and found that this was a common experience.  They're going back to the store tomorrow.
