 Easily the worst toaster ever.  Brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked.  There are just not enough words in the English Language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc. etc..  Well, maybe not useless, if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet.  I'd give it a minus 5 stars, but they do not even have a 0 star vote
