 Please do your self a favor and do not buy this item.  As a toaster oven it burns the bottoms of everything you heat in it.  As a toaster to toast bread or bagels, well it still has yet to toast anything for us.  You can run the toaster 6 times and it will never toast/brown.  I was shocked that this item would be so bad being that Hamilton Beach is a good brand.
 Something is obviously wrong with the production of this product.  Forget about purchasing this one.  If there was a zero for the star option on this product I would have given it a zero
