 I bought a machine similar to this one late last year - it broke after about 30 cups.  The 'tap' for the steam jammed.  I'm still waiting for the repaired machine to be returned after 3 months - yes months, not weeks.  According to DeLonghi service it will be another month before it's repaired.  I have no faith this will happen, nor that it will work for any length of time after I receive it.  Their service people, while reasonably pleasant, don't help - they know virtually nothing and seem reluctant to go beyond just answering your questions.  If you're smart, you'll go buy a coffee machine from someone else
