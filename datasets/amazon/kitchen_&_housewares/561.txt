 I purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot. In the past I have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers. At first, I was very pleased with the unit and thought I made a great purchase. Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so. Look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last. (it was only used 2-3 times a week
