 I really like OXO products.  I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles.  Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups.  Well I finally got them.  I was very excited to use them for the first time.  Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending.  I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are.  I think I'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO, I had better luck with them
