 I have depended on my French White - the "old" style - for many years.  I went to buy a few new pieces for myself, but discovered that Corning has changed the design.  "French White" is now nothing more than cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware.  I saw many chips and even a crack in the display models.  STUPID Corning! They seem to have forgotten that Corningware was designed to be the smart alternative to that cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware!  PLEASE SAVE YOUR $$$
