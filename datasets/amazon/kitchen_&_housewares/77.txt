 When I bought this item I attempted to test it in hot water. My only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate.  It appeared to register better than the grocery store model.  However, when using it to make chocolate fudge, by the time it registered 225 degree's, the fudge was thickening in the pan, not a pretty sight.  I used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction.  It has a 5 year Limited Warranty for replacement.  I don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as I don't want another of this brands products, ever.  It's going in the garbage as I attempt to find an accurate, well calibrated candy thermometer
