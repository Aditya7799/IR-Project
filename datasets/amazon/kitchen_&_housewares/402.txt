 Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best
