 I used this thermometer fewer than 10 times before it stopped working.  For the most part, it no longer registers any temperature, and when it does it reads 75-100 degrees too cool.  While it was working, I definitely preferred it to my analog candy thermometer because it was less bulky, but I certainly can't recommend it now.  
 
 The clip still works, though, and coupled with my wonderful Polder probe thermometer, I've got the best candy thermometer ever
